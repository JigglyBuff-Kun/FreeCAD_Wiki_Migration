title: All workbenches at a glance
---

As previously mentioned, FreeCAD offers various workbenches, each dedicated to different applications. Although the multitude of options might seem overwhelming at first, each workbench is designed to cater to specific tasks, making the overall workflow more efficient and tailored to various project requirements. For instance, the Part Design workbench is ideal for creating and modifying solid 3D models, while the Draft workbench is perfect for 2D drafting and drawing. This modular approach allows users to customize their interface and toolset according to their specific needs and preferences.

On this page, you will find information regarding the basic set of workbenches and their functionalities. For additional information, feel free to refer to each [workbench](/Workbenches "Workbenches") page in the FreeCAD documentation for a more complete list.

An interesting feature of FreeCAD is the ability to obtain additional information by hovering the mouse over a command. This tooltip functionality helps users understand what each command does, providing guidance and making it easier to learn and navigate the software.

Four workbenches are also designed to work in pairs, with one fully incorporated into the other: BIM contains all the Draft tools, and Part Design includes all the Sketcher tools. However, for clarity, they are separated below.

### Part

The ![](/src/assets/images/Workbench_Part.svg) [Part Workbench](/Part_Workbench "Part Workbench") offers fundamental tools for working with solid parts, including primitives like cubes and spheres, as well as basic geometric and boolean operations. Serving as the primary link with [OpenCasCade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Cascade_Technology), the Part Workbench forms the cornerstone of FreeCAD's geometry system, with nearly all other workbenches generating Part-based geometry. This parametric modeling system enables precise control and modification of 3D models through a history-based workflow. Users can build and refine complex designs by stacking and adjusting simpler shapes and operations, ensuring a robust and flexible design process.

### Part Design

The ![](/src/assets/images/Workbench_PartDesign.svg) [PartDesign Workbench](/PartDesign_Workbench "PartDesign Workbench") in FreeCAD is an essential tool for creating and modifying solid 3D models. It allows users to design complex parts by sketching 2D profiles and then applying various operations such as extrusions, lofts, and revolutions to generate 3D geometry. This workbench also supports the creation of features like pockets, holes, fillets, and chamfers, providing a comprehensive set of tools for detailed part design. Additionally, the Part Design Workbench integrates seamlessly with the Sketcher Workbench, enabling users to define and constrain sketches that serve as the foundation for 3D models. This integration facilitates a parametric design approach, allowing for easy adjustments and updates to the model throughout the design process.

### Draft

The ![](/src/assets/images/Workbench_Draft.svg) [Draft Workbench](/Draft_Workbench "Draft Workbench") in FreeCAD is designed for creating and editing 2D drawings. It offers a range of tools for drafting, including lines, arcs, circles, and text. Users can also perform operations like trimming, extending, and offsetting. The Draft Workbench is particularly useful for architectural drawings and can be used to create complex 2D geometries that can be later transformed into 3D models. It integrates seamlessly with other workbenches, providing a versatile foundation for both 2D and 3D design projects.

### Sketcher

The ![](/src/assets/images/Workbench_Sketcher.svg) [Sketcher Workbench](/Sketcher_Workbench "Sketcher Workbench") contains tools to build and edit complex 2D objects, called sketches. The geometry inside these sketches can be precisely positioned and related by the use of constraints. They are primarily meant to be the building blocks of PartDesign geometry but are useful everywhere in FreeCAD.

### BIM

The ![](/src/assets/images/Workbench_BIM.svg) [BIM Workbench](/BIM_Workbench "BIM Workbench") (a combination of the former BIM, Native-IFC and Arch Workbenches) workbench is tailored for architectural design and construction planning, offering tools to create and manipulate parametric building elements like walls, slabs, columns, beams, roofs, and windows. It supports IFC (Industry Foundation Classes) for seamless data exchange with other BIM software, facilitating collaboration. Users can generate detailed 2D drawings, annotations, and construction documentation from 3D models, integrating closely with the Draft workbench for tasks like creating floor plans, sections, and elevations.

### Other built-in workbenches

Although the above summarizes the most important tools of FreeCAD, many more workbenches are available, among them:

- The [TechDraw Workbench](/TechDraw_Workbench "TechDraw Workbench") for producing technical drawings from 3D models.
- The [Mesh Workbench](/Mesh_Workbench "Mesh Workbench") allows to work with [polygon meshes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygon_mesh). Although meshes are not the preferred type of geometry to work with in FreeCAD, because of their lack of precision and support for curves, meshes still have a lot of uses and are fully supported in FreeCAD. The Mesh Workbench also offers a number of Part-to-Mesh and Mesh-to-Part tools.
- The [Spreadsheet Workbench](/Spreadsheet_Workbench "Spreadsheet Workbench") permits the creation and manipulation of spreadsheet data, that can be extracted from FreeCAD models. Spreadsheet cells can also be referenced in many areas of FreeCAD, making it possible to use them as master data structures.
- The [FEM Workbench](/FEM_Workbench "FEM Workbench") deals with [Finite Elements Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_element_method) and makes it possible to perform pre- and post-processing of FEM analyses and to display the results graphically.

### External workbenches

A number of other very useful workbenches produced by FreeCAD community members also exist. Although they are not included in a standard FreeCAD installation, they are easy to install as plug-ins. They are all referenced in the [FreeCAD-addons](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD-addons) repository. Among the most developed are:

- The [Drawing Dimensioning Workbench](https://github.com/hamish2014/FreeCAD_drawing_dimensioning) offers many new tools to work directly on Drawing Sheets and allow you to add dimensions, annotations and other technical symbols with great control over their aspect. **The Drawing Dimensioning Workbench is no longer maintained.**
- The [Fasteners Workbench](https://github.com/shaise/FreeCAD_FastenersWB) offers a wide range of ready-to-insert fasteners objects like screws, bolts, rods, washers and nuts. Many options and settings are available.
- The [A2plus](https://github.com/kbwbe/A2plus) workbench offers a series of tools to mount and work with [assemblies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_modelling).
