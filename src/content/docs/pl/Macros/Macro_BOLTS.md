## Description

The aim of BOLTS is to build a free and open-source standard parts library for CAD applications. It does so by providing a common database that can be utilized by many different CAD applications, and leveraging the parametric power of FreeCAD to create many different variatiants and sizes of a part.

BOLTS for FreeCAD provides a widget that allows to insert parts into the active document. Sizes and variants of a part can be selected in the widget, and the part is given a descriptive label.

## Script

More information about BOLTS can be found on its web page [www.bolts-library.org](https://www.bolts-library.org/en/index.html) and it's github <https://github.com/boltsparts>

The github also provides a repo [BOLTSFC](https://github.com/boltsparts/BOLTSFC) that BOLTSFC that is directly installable in FreeCAD.

**note**: BOLTSFC is also part of the [FreeCAD addons](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD-addons) and can be installed from the addons installer macro

## Usage

There are detailed instruction in the [Documentation section](https://github.com/boltsparts/BOLTSFC/blob/master/README.md) of the webpage:

- How to install BOLTS for FreeCAD
- How to setup a toolbar button for BOLTS
- How to use BOLTS for FreeCAD

## Contribute

A library of parts that is useful for a broad range of people can only be realised as a community effort. There are many possibilities to [contribute](https://boltsparts.github.io/en/contribute.html) to BOLTS in a number of different ways.
