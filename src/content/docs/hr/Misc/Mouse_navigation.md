## Pregled

FreeCAD **navigacija mišem'** sastoji se od naredbi koje se koriste za vizualno kretanje 3D prostorom i interakciju s prikazanim objektima. FreeCAD podržava više stilova navigacije mišem. Zadani navigacijski stil naziva se [CAD ​​navigacija](#CAD_navigation) i vrlo je jednostavan i praktičan, ali FreeCAD također nudi nekoliko alternativnih navigacijskih stilova za odabir. Odabrani stil koristi se za sve radne površine.

For more information about selecting objects see [Selection methods](/Selection_methods "Selection methods").

For more information about manipulating objects see [Std TransformManip](/Std_TransformManip "Std TransformManip").

## Selecting a navigation style

1. Do one of the following:
   * Press the ![](/images/NavigationCAD_dark.svg) button in the [Status bar](/Status_bar "Status bar").
   * Right-click an empty area in the [3D view](/3D_view "3D view"), and select **Navigation styles** from the context menu.
   * Use the [Preferences Editor](/Preferences_Editor#Navigation "Preferences Editor"). In the menu select **Edit → Preferences** and then **Display → Navigation → 3D Navigation**.
2. Select a style from the list.
3. Optionally change the **Orbit style**: press the ![](/images/NavigationCAD_dark.svg) button in the [Status bar](/Status_bar "Status bar") and then choose **Settings → Orbit style**. See [Preferences Editor](/Preferences_Editor#Navigation "Preferences Editor").
4. Optionally change the **Rotation mode**. See [Preferences Editor](/Preferences_Editor#Navigation "Preferences Editor").
5. If the **CAD** navigation style is selected: optionally change the **Enable animation** setting. See [Preferences Editor](/Preferences_Editor#Navigation "Preferences Editor").

## Available navigation styles

With all navigation styles, unless selecting objects from a sketch in edit mode, you must hold Ctrl to select multiple objects.

The following keyboard options are available for all styles:

* Ctrl + ![](/images/Ascii_043.svg) and Ctrl + ![](/images/Ascii_022.svg) or PgUp and PgDn to zoom in and out, respectively.
* The arrow keys, ![](/images/Ascii_017.svg)![](/images/Ascii_016.svg)![](/images/Ascii_030.svg)![](/images/Ascii_031.svg), to pan the view left/right and up/down.
* Shift + ![](/images/Ascii_017.svg) and Shift + ![](/images/Ascii_016.svg) to rotate the view by 90 degrees.

### Blender Navigacija

The Blender navigation style was modeled after [Blender](https://www.blender.org).

The Blender Navigation was modeled after [Blender](http://www.blender.org). Previously there was no mouse-only panning, and it required use of the SHIFT key to pan the view. This changed in 2016 with a feature-addition. In order to pan the view, you can now press both left and right mouse buttons and drag in the view.

| Select | Zoom | Rotate view | Pan | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  |  |  | |
|  |  |  | Shift+ |  |
| Press the left mouse button over an object you want to select. | Use the mouse wheel to zoom in and out. | Hold the middle mouse button, then move the pointer. | Hold Shift and the middle mouse button, then move the pointer. Alternatively, hold both left and right mouse buttons, and then move the pointer. | |

|Shift=Shift

|Select\_text=Press the left mouse button over an object you want to select.

|Zoom\_text=Use the mouse wheel to zoom in and out.

|Rotate\_view\_text=Hold the middle mouse button, then move the pointer.

|Pan\_text=Hold Shift and the middle mouse button, then move the pointer.

Alternatively, hold both left and right mouse buttons, and then move the pointer.

### CAD navigacija

### CAD Navigation (default)

This is the default navigation style and allows the user a simple control of the view, and does not require the use of keyboard keys except to make multi-selections.

| Select | Zoom | Rotate view First method | Rotate view Alternate method | Pan |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |
| Press the left mouse button over an object you want to select. Holding down Ctrl allows the selection of multiple objects. | Use the mouse wheel to zoom in and out. Clicking the middle mouse button re-centers the view on the location of the cursor. | Hold the middle mouse button, then press and hold the left mouse button, then move the pointer. The cursor location when the middle mouse button is pressed determines the center of rotation. Rotation works like spinning a ball which rotates around its center. If the buttons are released before you stop the mouse motion, the view continues [spinning](/Spinning "Spinning"), if this is enabled.  A double click with the middle mouse button sets a new center of rotation. | Hold the middle mouse button, then press and hold the right mouse button, then move the pointer. With this method the middle mouse button may be released after the right mouse button is held pressed.  Users who use the mouse with their right hand may find this method easier than the first method. | Hold the middle mouse button, then move the pointer. |
|  | Ctrl+Shift+ | Shift+ |  | Ctrl+ |
|  | Zoom mode: hold the Ctrl and Shift keys, press the right mouse button once, then move the pointer. [introduced in 0.17](/Release_notes_0.17 "Release notes 0.17") | Rotate mode: hold the Shift key, press the right mouse button once, then move the pointer. [introduced in 0.17](/Release_notes_0.17 "Release notes 0.17") |  | Pan mode: hold the Ctrl key, press the right mouse button once, then move the pointer. [introduced in 0.17](/Release_notes_0.17 "Release notes 0.17") |

|  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |
| Press the left mouse button over an object you want to select. | Use the mouse wheel to zoom in and out. Clicking the middle mouse button re-centers the view on the location of the cursor. | Hold the middle mouse button, then press and hold the left mouse button, then move the pointer. If the buttons are released before you stop the mouse motion, the view continues spinning, if this is enabled. | Hold the middle mouse button, then press and hold the right mouse button, then move the pointer. With this method the middle mouse button may be released after the right mouse button is held pressed.  Users who use the mouse with their right hand may find this method easier than the first method. | Hold the middle mouse button, then move the pointer. |
|  | Ctrl+Shift+ | Shift+ |  | Ctrl+ |
|  | Zoom mode: hold the Ctrl and Shift keys, press the right mouse button once, then move the pointer. | Rotate mode: hold the Shift key, press the right mouse button once, then move the pointer. |  | Pan mode: hold the Ctrl key, press the right mouse button once, then move the pointer. |

### Upravljanje pokretima (v0.16)

This style was tailored for use with a touchscreen and pen. Nevertheless, it can also be used with a mouse, and is recommended for use when using a Mac with a trackpad.

This navigation style was tailored for usability with touchscreen and pen, but is very usable with mouse too.

### Maya-Gesture Navigation

In Maya-Gesture Navigation, panning, zooming, and rotating the view require the Alt key together with a mouse button; therefore, a three-button mouse is required. It's also possible to use gestures as this style was developed over the [Gesture navigation](#Gesture_navigation) style.

In Maya-Gesture Navigation, all view movements are activated pressing ALT and a mouse button, so that it will be needed to have a 3 button mouse in order to correctly use this navigation mode. Alternately it's possible to use gestures as this mode was been developed over the normal Gesture Navigation mode.

## Hardware support

FreeCAD also supports some [3D input devices](/3D_input_devices "3D input devices").

## Recommended navigation for macOS

On MacBooks with a trackpad the Gesture navigation works very well, but the gestures have a special meaning:

* Zoom: drag with two fingers.
* Rotate: drag with three fingers.
* Pan: Ctrl + three fingers.
