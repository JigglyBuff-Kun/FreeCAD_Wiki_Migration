## Opis

The **Std Quit** command closes the FreeCAD application and optionally saves unsaved documents.

## Koristi

1. There are several ways to invoke the command:
   * Select the **File → ![](/images/Std_Quit.svg) Exit** option from the menu.
   * Use the keyboard shortcut: Alt+F4.
2. If there are unsaved documents a dialog box will prompt you to save them:
   * Press the Save button to save the active document. If required enter a filename first.
   * Press the Discard button to discard the active document and lose all changes.

## Options

* If there are multiple unsaved documents: check the **Apply answer to all** checkbox to avoid being prompted for each unsaved document separately.
* If there are unsaved documents: press Esc or the Cancel button to abort the command.
