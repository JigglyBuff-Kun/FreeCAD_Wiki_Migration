## Description

The **Std WhatsThis** command opens the help documentation for a specific command.

Since FreeCAD version 0.20 this command and the Help system are managed by a separate Help Module. For versions 0.20 and 0.21 this module is an [addon](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD-Help) that must be [installed](/Std_AddonMgr "Std AddonMgr") separately. In later versions the Help Module is integrated in FreeCAD.

## Usage

1. There are several ways to invoke the command:
   * Press the ![](/images/Std_WhatsThis.svg) [What's This?](/Std_WhatsThis "Std WhatsThis") button.
   * Select the **Help → ![](/images/Std_WhatsThis.svg) What's This?** option from the menu.
   * Use the keyboard shortcut: Shift+F1.
2. Click a toolbar button or a menu option.
3. The help documentation for the selected command opens.

## Notes

* The Help system has a number of preferences. See [Preferences Editor](/Preferences_Editor#Help "Preferences Editor").
