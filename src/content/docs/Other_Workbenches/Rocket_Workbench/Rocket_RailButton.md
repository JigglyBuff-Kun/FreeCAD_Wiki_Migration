## Description

A rail button is a small button attached to the side of the rocket that allows the rocket to be guided using a rail until it is fast enough to be aerodynamically stable.

## Usage

1. There are several ways to invoke the command:
   - Press the ![](/images/Rocket_RailGuide.svg) [Rail Button](/Rocket_RailButton "Rocket RailButton") button.
   - Select the **Rocket → Launch Guides→ ![](/images/Rocket_RailButton.svg) Rail Button** option from the menu.
   - Double click on a Rail Button object in the [Tree view](/Tree_view "Tree view").
2. Set options and press OK.

## Options

### Rail Button Shapes

Rail buttons have two general shapes:

- Round.

Round Rail Button

The round shape is the most common and is the simplest to manufacture in bulk. As the name implies, the button is round, with a groove that allows it to fit onto the launch rail. It may be glued to the main body, but is more typically fastened with a screw.

- Airfoil.

Airfoiled Rail Button

The airfoil shape improved on the basic round button by giving it a more streamlined shape. Similar to the round button, it has a groove that allows it to fit on the launch rail. Adding a fillet on the top edges has been shown to further improve aerodynamic performance.
