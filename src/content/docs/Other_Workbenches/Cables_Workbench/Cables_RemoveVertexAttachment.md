## Description

The ![](/src/assets/images/Cables_RemoveVertexAttachment.svg) [Remove Vertex Attachment](/Cables_RemoveVertexAttachment "Cables RemoveVertexAttachment") removes an existing vertex attachment of ![](/src/assets/images/Cables_WireFlex.svg) [WireFlex](/Cables_WireFlex "Cables WireFlex") from external vertex or object. Attachments of vertexes are kept in special properties of WireFlex, for details see [WireFlex Properties](/Cables_WireFlex#Properties "Cables WireFlex").

Once attachment is removed the wire vertex can be moved freely in 3D space using [Draft Edit](/Draft_Edit "Draft Edit").

## Usage

1. Select one vertex of an existing [WireFlex](/Cables_WireFlex "Cables WireFlex") object in the [3D view](/3D_view "3D view").
2. Remove selected vertex attachment by one of these methods:
   - Press the ![](/src/assets/images/Cables_RemoveVertexAttachment.svg) [Remove Vertex Attachment](/Cables_RemoveVertexAttachment "Cables RemoveVertexAttachment") button.
   - Select the **Cable Wires → ![](/src/assets/images/Cables_RemoveVertexAttachment.svg) Remove Vertex Attachment** option from the menu.
   - Right-click in the [Tree view](/Tree_view "Tree view") or the [3D view](/3D_view "3D view") and select the **Cable Wires → ![](/src/assets/images/Cables_RemoveVertexAttachment.svg) Remove Vertex attachment** option from the context menu.

## Notes

- See the [WireFlex Description](/Cables_WireFlex#Description "Cables WireFlex") and [WireFlex Usage](/Cables_WireFlex#Usage "Cables WireFlex") for the details how to use WireFlex.
