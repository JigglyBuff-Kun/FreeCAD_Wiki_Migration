## Description

The ![](/src/assets/images/Extract.svg) **Extract face** lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Curabitur at felis ut urna auctor pharetra id at nulla. . This tool is part of the [external workbench](/External_workbenches "External workbenches") called [Design456](/Design456_Workbench "Design456 Workbench").

## Usage

1. Switch to the ![](/src/assets/images/Design456_workbench_icon.svg) [Design456](/Design456_Workbench "Design456 Workbench") workbench (install from ![](/src/assets/images/Std_AddonMgr.svg) [Addon Manager](/Std_AddonMgr "Std AddonMgr") is necessary, if not previously installed)
2. Select a face of an object, run the ![](/src/assets/images/Extract.svg) Extract command. A copy of the face will be created. Might be difficult to see it but it is there.

This might be helpful to create a 2D drawing of a complex shape that you later manipulate to get another 3D shape after extrusion.

## Limitations

Works on 3D objects.
