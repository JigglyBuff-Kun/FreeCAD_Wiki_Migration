## Description

The ![](/src/assets/images/Design456_MultiPointsToWireOpen.svg) **Design456 Multi Points To Wire - Open** lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Curabitur at felis ut urna auctor pharetra id at nulla. This tool is part of the [external workbench](/External_workbenches "External workbenches") called [Design456](/Design456_Workbench "Design456 Workbench").

## Usage

1. Switch to the ![](/src/assets/images/Design456_workbench_icon.svg) [Design456](/Design456_Workbench "Design456 Workbench") workbench (install from ![](/src/assets/images/Std_AddonMgr.svg) [Addon Manager](/Std_AddonMgr "Std AddonMgr") is necessary, if not previously installed)
2. You need to select at least 2 vertices before pressing the command. Order of selecting the points is important. First point selected will be the start of the wire and the last point selected will be the end. This tool is similar to the another tool: ![](/src/assets/images/Design456_MultiPointsToWireClose.svg) [MultiPointsToWireClose](/Design456_MultiPointsToWireClose "Design456 MultiPointsToWireClose"), but this one is not closing the wire and no shape or surface will be created.

## Limitations

When you select the points in the object lists, the points aren't green. That causes a problem for the tool at the moment. It is strange that selecting the points in the object list are not equal to select them by clicking the points with the mouse. To avoid this problem you have to select the points by the mouse and clicking them so they are green when you use the command.
