## Description

The ![](/images/Design456_3Point.svg) Design456 3Point lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Curabitur at felis ut urna auctor pharetra id at nulla. . This tool is part of the [external workbench](/External_workbenches "External workbenches") called [Design456](/Design456_Workbench "Design456 Workbench").

## Usage

1. Switch to the ![](/images/Design456_workbench_icon.svg) [Design456](/Design456_Workbench "Design456 Workbench") workbench (install from ![](/images/Std_AddonMgr.svg) [Addon Manager](/Std_AddonMgr "Std AddonMgr") is necessary, if not previously installed)
2. You need to have 3 vertices selected before pressing the icon. The points you choose or select could be from other shapes for example a cube, or they could be just create 3 points and you put them on any plane (delete them later if you want). You can combine several planes to get a curve crossing several planes. This tool is useful if you want to use it with surface tool to create a new surface. Any three vertices should be sufficient to create the arc. Combining two arcs could be used to make a circle also.

There might be other way to put the vertices on the plane but you get the idea how to use it.

1. Invoke the Fasteners BOM tool several ways:
   - Press the ![](/images/Design456_3Point.svg) button
