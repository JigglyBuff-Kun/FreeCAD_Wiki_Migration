## Description

The ![](/src/assets/images/Design456_Extrude.svg) **Extrude** lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Curabitur at felis ut urna auctor pharetra id at nulla. This tool is part of the [external workbench](/External_workbenches "External workbenches") called [Design456](/Design456_Workbench "Design456 Workbench").

## Usage

1. Switch to the ![](/src/assets/images/Design456_workbench_icon.svg) [Design456](/Design456_Workbench "Design456 Workbench") workbench (install from ![](/src/assets/images/Std_AddonMgr.svg) [Addon Manager](/Std_AddonMgr "Std AddonMgr") is necessary, if not previously installed)
2. Select a face, run the command ![](/src/assets/images/Design456_Extrude.svg) Extrude. It will ask you the length. After giving the length, the Extrude will be done.

## Limitations

Extrude doesn't work on 3D objects. This limitation is from the fact that many shapes are read-only in FreeCAD. You need to create a face, extrude the face, and later remove the face. You might merge them if you want.
There is a tool in Design456 which does that job.
