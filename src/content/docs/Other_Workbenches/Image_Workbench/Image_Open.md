## Description

The [Image Open](/Image_Open "Image Open") tool simply opens an image from your system in a new tab in the viewport.

## Usage

1. Press the ![](/images/Image_Open.svg) [Image Open](/Image_Open "Image Open") button.
2. Select the image file that you want.

The image is placed in a new viewport, not in the 3D view.
