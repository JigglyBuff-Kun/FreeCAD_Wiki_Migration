## Introduction

Pyrate or pyrate optics is an optical raytracing core written completely in Python. It is supposed to provide as much as functionality like commercial optical design software. The workbench is intended as an easy to use FreeCAD interface for that purpose. Since a large refactor in 2017 the interface is mostly broken. Therefore the raytracer is only usable at the script level without good integration into FreeCAD. Although the Python interface provides functions to create, optimize and modify optical systems and therefore these capabilities are also available to FreeCAD.

## Install

This workbench is a new style workbench. This means it is intended to install it by the AddOnInstaller with pip for FreeCAD versions >= 0.18.
