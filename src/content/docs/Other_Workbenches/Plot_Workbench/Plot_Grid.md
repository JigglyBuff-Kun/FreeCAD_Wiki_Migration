## Usage

Select the plot tab that you want to edit, and run this tool to change the state of the grid lines, i.e. enable them if they are disabled, disable them otherwise.

This tool acts on the active set of axis. In case of multi-axes plots you can select the active set of axes with the [axes configuration tool](/Plot_Axes "Plot Axes").
