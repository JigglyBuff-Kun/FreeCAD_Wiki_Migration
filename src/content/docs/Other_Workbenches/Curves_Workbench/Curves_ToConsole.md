## Description

The ![](/images/Curves_ToConsole.svg) [Curves ToConsole](/Curves_ToConsole "Curves ToConsole") tool gives access to the selected objects in the Python console.

## Usage

1. Select one or more objects in the [3D view](/3D_view "3D view") or in the [Tree view](/Tree_view "Tree view").
2. There are several ways to invoke the tool:
   - Press the ![](/images/Curves_ToConsole.svg) [Objects to Console](/Curves_ToConsole "Curves ToConsole") button
   - Select the **Misc. → ![](/images/Curves_ToConsole.svg) Objects to Console** option from the menu
3. A list of commands that give access to the objects in the selection, and their actually selected sub-objects is displayed in the [Python console](/Python_console "Python console").

## Notes

- This tool only lists commands in the Python console, it doesn't create any object.
