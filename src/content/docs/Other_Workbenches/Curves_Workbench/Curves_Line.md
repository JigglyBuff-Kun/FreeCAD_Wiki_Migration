## Description

The ![](/src/assets/images/Curves_Line.svg) **Curves Line** tool creates a parametric line between two vertices.

## Usage

1. Select two vertices in the [3D view](/3D_view "3D view").
2. There are several ways to invoke the tool:
   - Press the ![](/src/assets/images/Curves_Line.svg) [Parametric line](/Curves_Line "Curves Line") button.
   - Select the **Curves → ![](/src/assets/images/Curves_Line.svg) Parametric line** option from the menu.
3. A **Line** object is created.
