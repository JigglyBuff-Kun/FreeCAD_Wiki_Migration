## Description

The ![](/src/assets/images/Curves_AdjacentFaces.svg) **Curves AdjacentFaces** tool selects the adjacent faces of the selected sub shape.

## Usage

1. Select one or more vertices, edges, and/or faces.
2. There are several ways to invoke the tool:
   - Press the ![](/src/assets/images/Curves_AdjacentFaces.svg) Select Adjacent faces button.
   - Select the **Misc. → ![](/src/assets/images/Curves_AdjacentFaces.svg) Select Adjacent faces** option from the menu.
3. The selection is extended around each selected element.

## Notes

- This tool only extends the selection, it doesn't create any object.
