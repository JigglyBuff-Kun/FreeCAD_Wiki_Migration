## Description

The CfdOF Analysis could be seen as a Container that holds all objects of a Computational Fluid Dynamic Analysis. It is mandatory to have an analysis container which holds all the needed objects.

## Usage

1. There are several ways to invoke the command:
   - Press the ![](/images/CfdOF_analysis.svg) Analysis container button.
   - Select the **CfdOF → ![](/images/CfdOF_analysis.svg) Analysis container‏‎** option from the menu.
   - Use the keyboard shortcut: N then C.
2. A new Analysis is created and set to active.
3. The following child objects are automatically created within the Analysis container:
   - ![](/images/CfdOF_Physics_Model.svg) [Physics Model](/CfdOF_Physics_Model "CfdOF Physics Model")
   - ![](/images/CfdOF_Fluid_Properties.svg) [Fluid Properties](/CfdOF_Fluid_Properties "CfdOF Fluid Properties")
   - ![](/images/CfdOF_Initialise_Flow_Fields.svg) [Initialise Flow Fields](/index.php?title=CfdOF_Initialise_Flow_Fields&action=edit&redlink=1 "CfdOF Initialise Flow Fields (page does not exist)")
   - ![](/images/CfdOF_CFD_Solver.svg) [CFD Solver](/CfdOF_CFD_Solver "CfdOF CFD Solver")
4. Additional objects can be added to the Analysis container by pressing the CfdOF buttons or selecting from the CfdOF Menu.
