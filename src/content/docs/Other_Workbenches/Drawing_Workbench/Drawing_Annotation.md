## Description

This command allows you to place a block of text on a [Drawing page](/Drawing_Landscape_A3 "Drawing Landscape A3").

## Usage

1. Create a [Drawing page](/Drawing_Landscape_A3 "Drawing Landscape A3")
2. [Refresh](/Std_Refresh "Std Refresh") the view if a Drawing view wasn't opened
3. Press the ![](/images/Drawing_Annotation.png) [Drawing Annotation](/Drawing_Annotation "Drawing Annotation") button
4. Adjust the desired properties, such as text contents, font, size and position.

## Limitations

- Texts spanned on multiple lines are not supported by the internal Qt-based Svg viewer, but the [Open Browser](/Drawing_Openbrowser "Drawing Openbrowser") command shows these texts correctly.
