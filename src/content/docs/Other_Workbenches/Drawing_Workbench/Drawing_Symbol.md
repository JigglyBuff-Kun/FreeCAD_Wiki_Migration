## Description

This command allows you to add the contents of a SVG image on a selected [Drawing page](/Drawing_Landscape_A3 "Drawing Landscape A3"). These contents can then be moved and rescaled on the page. The contents of the SVG image are copied into the FreeCAD document, so it is independent from the original file, and will display the same way on another computer that doesn't have the original SVG file.

## Usage

1. Create a [Drawing page](/Drawing_Landscape_A3 "Drawing Landscape A3")
2. [Refresh](/Std_Refresh "Std Refresh") the view if a Drawing viewer wasn't opened
3. Press the ![](/src/assets/images/Drawing_Symbol.png) [Drawing Symbol](/Drawing_Symbol "Drawing Symbol") button
4. Select a SVG file
5. Adjust the needed properties, like position and scale.
