## Description

This tool builds a link between two objects of an assembly and fixes the distance between them. The selected elements of each object or more precisely their implicit coordinate systems (ICS) are used to position one object to another.

It can handle 3D point elements as well as 2D point elements within a work plane.

## Usage

1. Place two objects into an assembly
2. Select one point element of each object
3. Press the ![](/src/assets/images/Assembly_ConstraintPointDistance.svg) [Point distance](/Assembly3_ConstraintPointDistance "Assembly3 ConstraintPointDistance") button.
