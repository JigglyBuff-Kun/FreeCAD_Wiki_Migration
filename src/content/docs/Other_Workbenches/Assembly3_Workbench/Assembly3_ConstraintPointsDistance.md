## Description

This tool builds a link between two objects of an assembly and fixes the distance between them and the orientation to each other. The selected elements of each object or more precisely their implicit coordinate systems (ICS) are used to position one object to another.

## Usage

1. Place two objects into an assembly
2. Select one point element of each object
3. Press the ![](/src/assets/images/Assembly_ConstraintPointsDistance.svg) [Points distance](/Assembly3_ConstraintPointsDistance "Assembly3 ConstraintPointsDistance") button.
