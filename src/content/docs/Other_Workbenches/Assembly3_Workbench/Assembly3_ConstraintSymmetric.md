## Description

This tool builds a link between two objects of an assembly and matches their orientation. The selected elements of each object or more precisely their implicit coordinate systems (ICS) are used to position one object to another.

## Usage

1. Place two objects into an assembly.
2. Select one element of each object and a mirroring plane.
3. Press the ![](/images/Assembly_ConstraintSymmetric.svg) [Symmetric](/Assembly3_ConstraintSymmetric "Assembly3 ConstraintSymmetric") button.
