## Introduction

[Assembly4](/Assembly4_Workbench "Assembly4 Workbench") is an [external workbench](/External_workbenches "External workbenches") that is used to perform assembly of different bodies contained in a single file or in multiple documents. It was created in the v0.19 development cycle to take advantage of Assembly3 branch's new features, such as the [App Link](/App_Link "App Link") object, and the new [expression engine](/Expressions "Expressions").

It was developed with the idea that a true constraint solver was not needed, and instead the [expression engine](/Expressions "Expressions") was enough to establish relationships between different local coordinate systems attached to bodies. Thus its prototype name was "Assembly without solver" or AWS.

## Installation

Assembly4 can be installed from the [Addon Manager](/Std_AddonMgr "Std AddonMgr").

## Compatibility

Assembly4 was developed from the new tools created for [Assembly3](/Assembly3_Workbench "Assembly3 Workbench"), in particular, the [App Link](/App_Link "App Link") object and the improved [expression engine](/Expressions "Expressions").

Assembly4 was inspired by ![](/src/assets/images/A2p_workbench.svg) [A2plus](/A2plus_Workbench "A2plus Workbench") and ![](/src/assets/images/Assembly3_workbench_icon.svg) [Assembly3](/Assembly3_Workbench "Assembly3 Workbench") but it is not compatible with them. If you have older models made in those two workbenches, you should use those workbenches to open your models only.
