## Description

Calculates ship resistance by the Savitsky method. This method was formulated by Daniel Savitsky in 1964 [1], with application to fast vessels in a planing regime.

Plots the resistance curve, the equilibrium trim, the power prediction and the resistance coefficients. It also exports the results to a spreadsheet.

### Resistance graph

The resistance is represented in kN, as a function of speed in knots. It includes the total resistance, the total resistance and the pressure resistance.

### Trim graph

The equilibrium trim is represented in degrees, as a function of speed in knots.

### Power graph

The power is represented in kW, as a function of speed in knots. It includes the effective power and the break power.

### Coefficients graph

The resistance coefficients are adimensional, they are represented as a function of speed in knots. It includes the effective power and the break power.

### Exported Spreadsheet Data

The spreadsheet contains the values of different variables for each evaluated speed, separated by columns.

| ------------------------- | ---- |
| **Speed**                 | kn   |
| **Trim**                  | °    |
| **Total resistance**      | kN   |
| **Friction resistance**   | kN   |
| **Pressure resistance**   | kN   |

| **CP ×10³**               | -    |
| **CT ×10³**               | -    |
| **EKW (Effective Power)** | kW   |
| **BKW (Brake Power)**     | kW   |

## Usage

This tool does not have a strict dependency on a **Ship instance**(see [Ship CreateShip](/Ship_CreateShip "Ship CreateShip")), which means that it is possible to use it introducing the necessary ship data values in the dialogue.

### Using ship geometry

In order to execute the method, select a **Ship instance** and invoke **Resistance → ![](/images/Ship_ResistanceSavitsky.svg) Resistance Savitsky prediction**.

The ship data will be obtain from the ship and the user only needs to enter the boundary conditions. Data obtained from the vessel can be edited.

### Using ship data

In order to introduced the ship data manually, invoke **Resistance → ![](/images/Ship_ResistanceSavitsky.svg) Resistance Savitsky prediction** and fill the dialogue fields.
