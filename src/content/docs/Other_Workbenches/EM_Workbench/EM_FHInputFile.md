## Description

The FHInputFile tool creates the input FastHenry file based on the Document EM workbench objects.

## Usage

To create a FastHenry input file:

1. Create one [EM FHSolver](/EM_FHSolver "EM FHSolver") object and other EM workbench objects representing the 3D geometry as required for your model.
2. Press the ![](/images/EM_FHInputFile.svg) [EM FHInputFile](/EM_FHInputFile "EM FHInputFile") button, or press E then I keys.

### Remarks

- In case a file with the same name in the given folder as specified in the [EM FHSolver](/EM_FHSolver "EM FHSolver") object already exists, you will be prompted to overwrite or not.

- The Document can also contain non-EM Workbench objects. They will be ignored when creating the FastHenry input file. So you can use any other kind of FreeCAD object as guide for your EM Workbench models.

## Scripting

_See also:_ [FreeCAD Scripting Basics](/FreeCAD_Scripting_Basics "FreeCAD Scripting Basics").

The FHInputFile command can be used in [macros](/Macros "Macros") and from the [Python](/Python "Python") console by using the following function:

```
node = createFHInputFile(doc=None,filename=None,folder=None)

```

- Outputs a FastHenry input file based on the active document geometry.
- `doc` is the Document object that must contain at least one EM_FHSolver object and the relevant geometry. If no `doc` is given, the active document is used, if any.
- `filename` is the filename to use. If not passed as an argument, the Data**Filename** property of the FHSolver object contained in the document will be used. If the Data**Folder** string in the FHSolver object is empty, the function builds a filename concatenating the document name with the default extension `EMFHSOLVER_DEF_FILENAME`.
- `folder` is the folder where the file will be stored. If not passed as an argument, the Data**Folder** property of the FHSolver object contained in the document will be used. If the Data**Folder** string in the FHSolver object is empty, the function defaults to the user's home path (e.g. in Windows "C:\Documents and Settings\username\My Documents", in Linux "/home/username")

Example:

```
import FreeCAD, EM

fhsolver = EM.createFHInputFile()

```
