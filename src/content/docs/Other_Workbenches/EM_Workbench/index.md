## Introduction

The EM (ElectroMagnetic) Workbench provides the CAD front-end interface to some open source free solvers. At present it supports the 3D magnetoquasistatic impedance solver [FastHenry](https://www.fastfieldsolvers.com/software.htm#fasthenry2) (i.e. inductance and resistance extraction at "low" frequencies). Support for the 3D electrostatic capacitance solver [FasterCap](https://www.fastfieldsolvers.com/software.htm#fastercap) is ongoing.

## Installation

The [EM Workbench](/EM_Workbench "EM Workbench") is an [external workbench](/External_workbenches "External workbenches"), that can be installed from the FreeCAD ![](/src/assets/images/AddonManager.svg) [Addon Manager](/Std_AddonMgr "Std AddonMgr"). This can be done via the **Tools â†’ Addon Manager** menu.

The electromagnetic solvers FastHenry2 and FasterCap must be installed separately. Their binary codes as well as the sources are freely available from [FastFieldSolvers](https://www.fastfieldsolvers.com).

## Usage

### FastHenry

FastHenry is a software for computing the frequency-dependant self and mutual inductances and resistances of a generic tridimensional conductive structure, in the magnetoquasistatic approximation. It can also generate Spice-compatible, multiple-frequency equivalent-circuit models.

Knowledge of FastHenry is a pre-condition for the proficient usage of the ElectroMagnetic Workbench for FastHenry. We suggest you to read the original [FastHenry User's manual](https://www.fastfieldsolvers.com/documentation.htm) and play a bit with the sample files that are provided with the installation.

### FasterCap

FasterCap is a powerful three- and two-dimensional capacitance extraction program.

Knowledge of FasterCap is a pre-condition for the proficient usage of the ElectroMagnetic Workbench for FasterCap. We suggest you to read the original [FasterCap help file](https://www.fastfieldsolvers.com/documentation.htm) and play a bit with the sample files that are provided with the installation.

## FastHenry Tools

These are tools used to interface with FastHenry:

## FasterCap Tools

At present, FasterCap is supported via some Macros in the Export_mesh.py file available in the [ElectroMagnetic Workbench GitHub source code](https://github.com/ediloren/EM-Workbench-for-FreeCAD).

## API

The EM tools can be used in [macros](/Macros "Macros") and from the [Python](/Python "Python") console by using the EM API.
