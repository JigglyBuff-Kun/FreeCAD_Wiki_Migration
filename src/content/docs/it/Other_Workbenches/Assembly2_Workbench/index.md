title: Assembly2 Workbench
---

:::caution
The Assembly2 workbench is obsolete. Its author no longer maintains it, so it may not work with FreeCAD versions 0.17 and above. The information in this page is not maintained; it is just kept for historical purposes.
:::

For an alternative, see [A2plus](/A2plus_Workbench "A2plus Workbench"). This workbench is a fork of Assembly2, but it is not compatible with it. If you have older models that you need to open, you should stay with FreeCAD 0.16 and Assembly2. Newer models should be created entirely and opened with A2plus.  
For other options see [Assembly3](/Assembly3_Workbench "Assembly3 Workbench") or [Assembly4](/Assembly4_Workbench "Assembly4 Workbench"). These workbenches are also inspired by Assembly2, but are not compatible with it either.

## Introduction

Assembly2 Ã¨ un ambiente di assemblaggio per FreeCAD v0.15 con supporto per l'importazione di parti da file esterni.

As stated by its author [on the forum](https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=17&t=16591), it is no longer maintained since 2016, therefore it may have issues with FreeCAD 0.17 and above. The newer and actively maintained [A2plus Workbench](/A2plus_Workbench "A2plus Workbench") is a good alternative.

## Usage

Intended work-flow:

- each part in the assembly is designed in its own FreeCAD file
- a separate assembly FreeCAD file is created
- parts are imported to this assembly file using the Assembly 2 workbench
- spacial constraints are then added to assemble the imported parts

Features

- circular edge constraint
- axial constraint
- plane constraint
- part importing
- updating of parts already imported

Limitations

- Poor constraint solver which may fail or take excessively long for complicated assemblies
- undo and other similar features not supported

## Installation

### Automatic installation

This workbench can be installed from the [Addon Manager](/Std_AddonMgr "Std AddonMgr").

### From GitHub

To use this workbench clone this git repository under your FreeCAD Mod directory, and install the pyside and numpy Python libraries. On a Linux Debian based system such as Ubuntu, installation can be done through BASH as follows

```
sudo apt-get install git python-numpy python-pyside
mkdir ~/.FreeCAD/Mod
cd ~/.FreeCAD/Mod
git clone https://github.com/hamish2014/FreeCAD_assembly2.git

```

In FreeCAD you will now have a new workbench-entry called "Assembly 2". Once installed, use git to upgrade to the latest version through BASH as follows

```
cd ~/.FreeCAD/Mod/FreeCAD_assembly2
git pull
rm *.pyc

```

Alternatilvely, on an Ubuntu system the freecad-community PPA can be used:

```
Add ppa:freecad-community/ppa to your software sources
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install freecad-extras-assembly2

```

In Windows

- download the git repository as ZIP
- assuming FreeCAD is installed in "C:\PortableApps\FreeCAD 0_15", go to "C:\PortableApps\FreeCAD 0_15\Mod" within Windows Explorer
- create new directory named "assembly2"
- unzip downloaded repository in "C:\PortableApps\FreeCAD 0_15\Mod\assembly2"

FreeCAD will now have a new workbench-entry called "Assembly 2".

Pyside and Numpy are integrated in the FreeCAD 0.15 dev-Snapshots, so these Python packages do not need to be installed individually

To update to the latest version, delete the assembly2 folder and redownload the git repository.
