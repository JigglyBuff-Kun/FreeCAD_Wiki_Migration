## Latest CadQuery

The latest version of CadQuery is no longer using FreeCAD and is not compatible with the CadQuery workbench. If you are interested in the latest version have a look at the [CadQuery Python module](https://github.com/CadQuery/cadquery) and the [CadQuery graphical editor](https://github.com/CadQuery/CQ-editor).
