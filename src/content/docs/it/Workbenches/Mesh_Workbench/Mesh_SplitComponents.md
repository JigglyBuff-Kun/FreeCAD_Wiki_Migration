## Description

The **Mesh SplitComponents** command splits a mesh object into its components. A mesh component is a complete group of connected faces. For each component a new non-parametric mesh object, a [Mesh Feature](/Mesh_Feature "Mesh Feature"), is created. If the original mesh object contains only one component, and this is usually the case, a single new mesh object, effectively a copy, is created. This command is the counterpart of the [Mesh Merge](/Mesh_Merge "Mesh Merge") command.

## Usage

1. Select a single mesh object.
2. There are several ways to invoke the command:
   * Press the ![](/images/Mesh_SplitComponents.svg) [Split by components](/Mesh_SplitComponents "Mesh SplitComponents") button.
   * Select the **Meshes → ![](/images/Mesh_SplitComponents.svg) Split by components** option from the menu.

## Properties

See: [Mesh Feature](/Mesh_Feature "Mesh Feature").
