## Introduction

There is no roadmap for the whole FreeCAD project. If you want to get involved it is best to ask in the [Developer section](https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewforum.php?f=10) of the [FreeCAD forum](https://forum.freecadweb.org/index.php).

The following links may help you get started:

* The [Organization chart](/Organization_chart "Organization chart") shows who does what in the FreeCAD universe.
* The [current issues on GitHub](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue).
* The [Roadmap Category on this Wiki](/Category:Roadmap "Category:Roadmap"). Note that there are only very few pages in this category and as such they do not give a good representation of the current FreeCAD development.

## Roadmap project template

Some roadmaps on the Wiki use the [Getting Things Done (GTD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done#Methodology) style for the project document. Here is the [Project template](/Project_template "Project template").
