## Introduction

The [main view area](/Main_view_area "Main view area") is the main widget that holds sub-windows in the [interface](/Interface "Interface"). It is an instance of Qt's [QMdiArea](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qmdiarea.html).

It normally contains tabs for the start page from the [Start Workbench](/Start_Workbench "Start Workbench"), and the [3D view](/3D_view "3D view") for each document open. It can contain other window tabs, for example, one for each [TechDraw](/TechDraw_Workbench "TechDraw Workbench") [drawing page](/TechDraw_PageDefault "TechDraw PageDefault"), [spreadsheet](/Spreadsheet "Spreadsheet"), or [text document](/Std_TextDocument "Std TextDocument").

The main view area is denoted by the number 1, and can hold various window tabs, principally the start page and the [3D view](/3D_view "3D view").

## Windows

The windows in the main view area can be organized with commands located in the [Windows menu](/Std_Windows_Menu "Std Windows Menu"), like [Std TileWindows](/Std_TileWindows "Std TileWindows") and [Std CascadeWindows](/Std_CascadeWindows "Std CascadeWindows").
