## 설명

![](/images/Part_Box.svg) **부품 작업대에서 상자(Part Box)** 명령은 파라메트릭 상자 고체인 [직사각형 직육면체](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuboid#Rectangular_cuboid)를 만듭니다. 데이터**Placement** 속성으로 정의된 좌표계에서 상자의 바닥 면은 왼쪽 앞 꼭지점이 원점에 닿으면서 XY 평면 위에 놓이고, 앞쪽 모서리는 X축과 평행합니다.

## 용법

1. There are several ways to invoke the command:
   * Press the ![](/images/Part_Box.svg) [Cube](/Part_Box "Part Box") button.
   * Select the **Part → Primitives → ![](/images/Part_Box.svg) Cube** option from the menu.
2. The box is created.
3. Optionally change the dimensions and 데이터**Placement** of the box by doing one of the following:
   * Double-click the object in the [Tree view](/Tree_view "Tree view"):
     1. The **Geometric Primitives** task panel opens.
     2. Change one or more properties.
     3. The object is dynamically updated in the [3D view](/3D_view "3D view").
     4. Press the OK button.
   * Change the properties in the [Property editor](/Property_editor "Property editor").
   * Change the 데이터**Placement** with the ![](/images/Std_TransformManip.svg) [Std TransformManip](/Std_TransformManip "Std TransformManip") command.

Part Box from the scripting example

A Part Box object created with the [scripting example](#Scripting) below is shown here.

## Notes

* A Part Box can also be created with the ![](/images/Part_Primitives.svg) [Part Primitives](/Part_Primitives "Part Primitives") command. With that command you can specify the dimensions and placement at creation time.

## Properties

See also: [Property editor](/Property_editor "Property editor").

A Part Box object is derived from a [Part Feature](/Part_Feature "Part Feature") object and inherits all its properties. It also has the following additional properties:

### Data

Attachment

The object has the same attachment properties as a [Part Part2DObject](/Part_Part2DObject#Data "Part Part2DObject").

Box

* 데이터**Length** (`Length`): The length of the box. This is the dimension in its X direction. The default is `10mm`.
* 데이터**Width** (`Length`): The width of the box. This is the dimension in its Y direction. The default is `10mm`.
* 데이터**Height** (`Length`): The height of the box. This is dimension in its Z direction. The default is `10mm`.

## Scripting

See also: [Autogenerated API documentation](https://freecad.github.io/SourceDoc/), [Part scripting](/Part_scripting "Part scripting") and [FreeCAD Scripting Basics](/FreeCAD_Scripting_Basics "FreeCAD Scripting Basics").

A Part Box can be created with the `addObject()` method of the document:

```
box = FreeCAD.ActiveDocument.addObject("Part::Box", "myBox")

```

* Where `"myBox"` is the name for the object.
* The function returns the newly created object.

Example:

```
import FreeCAD as App

doc = App.activeDocument()

box = doc.addObject("Part::Box", "myBox")
box.Length = 4
box.Width = 8
box.Height = 12
box.Placement = App.Placement(App.Vector(1, 2, 3), App.Rotation(75, 60, 30))

doc.recompute()

```
