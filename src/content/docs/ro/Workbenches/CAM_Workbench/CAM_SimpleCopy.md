## Descriere

This tool creates a non-parametric copy of a given path.

## Utilizare

1. Select one [Path](/Path_Workbench "Path Workbench") object
2. Press the ![](/images/Path_SimpleCopy.png) [Simple Copy](/Path_SimpleCopy "Path SimpleCopy") button

## Opţiuni

* The simple copy is not bound anymore to the path that was used to make the copy, and is not parametric. Therefore, when edited with the [Path Inspect](/Path_Inspect "Path Inspect") tool, any change made to its G-code will be retained.
