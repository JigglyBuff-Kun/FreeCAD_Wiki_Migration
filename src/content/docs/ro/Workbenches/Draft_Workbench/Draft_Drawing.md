## Descriere

The ![](/images/Draft_Drawing.svg) **Draft Drawing** command inserts views of selected objects into a [drawing](/Drawing_Workbench "Drawing Workbench") page.

This command is similar to the [Drawing View](/Drawing_View "Drawing View") command but is optimized for [Draft](/Draft_Workbench "Draft Workbench") objects. Contrary to that command, it can handle specific objects such as [Draft Dimensions](/Draft_Dimension "Draft Dimension") and [Draft Texts](/Draft_Text "Draft Text"), and it can render faces.

This command is now obsolete. Use the [TechDraw Workbench](/TechDraw_Workbench "TechDraw Workbench") and the [TechDraw DraftView](/TechDraw_DraftView "TechDraw DraftView") command instead.

## Cum se folosește

1. Selectați obiectele pe care doriți să le puneți pe o foaie de desen
2. Apasă pe ![](/images/Draft_Drawing.png) [Draft Drawing](/Draft_Drawing "Draft Drawing") button
