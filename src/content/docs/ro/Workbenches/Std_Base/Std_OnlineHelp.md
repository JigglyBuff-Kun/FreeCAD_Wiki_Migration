De completat

The **Std OnlineHelp** command opens the help documentation. To open the documentation for a specific command, use the [Std WhatsThis](/Std_WhatsThis "Std WhatsThis") command.

Since FreeCAD version 0.20 this command and the Help system are managed by a separate Help Module. For versions 0.20 and 0.21 this module is an [addon](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD-Help) that must be [installed](/Std_AddonMgr "Std AddonMgr") separately. In later versions the Help Module is integrated in FreeCAD.

## Utilizare

1. There are several ways to invoke the command:
   * Select the **Help → ![](/images/Std_OnlineHelp.svg) Help** option from the menu.
   * Use the keyboard shortcut: F1.
2. The help documentation opens.

## Notes

* The Help system has a number of preferences. See [Preferences Editor](/Preferences_Editor#Help "Preferences Editor").
