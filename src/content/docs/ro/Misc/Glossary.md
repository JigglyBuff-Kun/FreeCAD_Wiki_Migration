Callout
:   String of text connected to a line pointing to an object in a [drawing](#Drawing).

Chamfer
:   The cutting off of an edge, at an angle, to get rid of its sharpness; a beveled edge.

Clipping Plane

If a constraint has a numerical value, it is referred to as Datum (e.g., a distance constraint has a numerical value - the length of an imaginary line connecting the two points). A constraint that has no numerical value (e.g., a Horizontal constraint) is sometimes referred to as Geometric Constraint.

[Constructive Solid Geometry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructive_solid_geometry)

DAG
:   See [Directed Acyclic Graph.](#Directed_Acyclic_Graph)

Degrees Of Freedom
:   The number of ways geometry in a [Sketch](#Sketch) may vary. For example, if we have a Sketch consisting of only one point, and the point has no [Constraints](#Constraint) applied to it, the point has two [DOF](#DOF) because it is free to move both vertically and horizontally. Similarly, a Sketch consisting of only a single unconstrained circle has three [DOF](#DOF) because the circle can move vertically and horizontally and, additionally, the radius is not defined. It is good practice to constrain a Sketch until it has no [DOF](#DOF) remaining, in which case it is said to be [Fully Constrained](#Fully_Constrained).

Dependency Graph
:   A third-party graphing tool used to show how objects in a FreeCAD model use or are related to one another. For more information, refer to the [Dependency Graph Wiki page](/Std_DependencyGraph "Std DependencyGraph")

Difference
:   1.  The result of, or remainder of, a subtraction.
:   2.  A [Boolean Operation](#Boolean_operation) in the [Part](/Part_Workbench "Part Workbench") [workbench](#Workbench) which is used to subtract one geometry from another; it results in a [Cut](#Cut).

Directed Acyclic Graph (abbreviated as "DAG")
:   A type of [Dependency Graph](#Dependency_Graph) where the relationship of objects flows in a generally linear direction from start to end with no circular dependencies. When following a DAG there is no flow from one object A to any other objects and then back to that same object A again. In FreeCAD, a graph of the model must always be a DAG.

DOF
:   [Degrees Of Freedom](#Degrees_Of_Freedom)

[Draft](/Draft_Workbench "Draft Workbench")
:   1.  A FreeCAD [workbench](#Workbench) used primarily for 2 dimensional work.

Edge
:   1.  A segment joining two [vertices](#Vertex). This segment can be a straight line or a curve. The CAD kernel defines it as: One-dimensional shape corresponding to a curve and bounded by a vertex at each extremity. A closed circle has therefore only one vertex, where it starts and ends. [[see Profile: Defining the Topology](https://dev.opencascade.org/doc/overview/html/occt__tutorial.html#OCCT_TUTORIAL_SUB2_3%7C)].
:   2.  The joining line between two faces. It can be curved or straight.

Hence a "Pocket" feature is not only the pocketed hole itself, but the whole part with the pocket feature.

:   See [Forked Model](#Forked_Model).

Forked Model
:   A modeling method, usually accidental and incorrect in FreeCAD, that creates two or more versions of a model from a previous item. (Not to be confused with intentional operations like Array, Clone, PolarPattern, etc.)

Frenet
:   When Sweeping a profile along a 3D path, the Frenet parameter controls the orientation of the profile as it travels along the path. If Frenet is true, the profiles are oriented using the Frenet Frame (tangent, binormal, normal) of the path. If Frenet is false the profile's rotation is not restricted. [[1]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frenet_Frame)

[FreeType](http://www.freetype.org)

Section
:   [Cross section (geometry)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_section_%28geometry%29)

Self Intersection
:   A condition where a curve crosses over itself (ex.'8','&'). This confuses geometric kernel algorithms and generally produces an error condition.

Shape
:   Generic term used in FreeCAD to describe most elements (except for [meshes](#Mesh)).

Shell
:   Shape made of two or more contiguous [faces](#Face). A [manifold](#Manifold) (enclosed) shell can be converted into a [solid](#Solid).

Sketch
:   A constrained 2D depiction of an object fixed to a plane or a [Face](#Face). In FreeCAD a Sketch is always a 2-dimensional object somewhere in the 3D space.

[Sketcher](/Sketcher_Workbench "Sketcher Workbench")
:   A [workbench](#Workbench) used to create 2D geometry by use of [elements](#Element) and [constraints](#Constraint).

Sketcher Solver
:   The internal FreeCAD mechanism that calculates inter-dependencies and effects of adding, deleting, and modifying geometry and associated constraints in each Sketch. Sketcher Solver also calculates the arrangement of all geometry in each Sketch so it can be displayed correctly.

Smooth Line
:   In a Drawing, a line indicating a change between tangent surfaces, as in the transition from a flat surface to a fillet. Also "tangent edge". See [Drawing View](http://www.freecadweb.org/wiki/index.php?title=Drawing_View#Modify_an_existing_view)

Solid
:   Part of 3D space bounded by [Shells](#Shell). A solid has a volume and other properties related to objects with a mass.

Solver
:   See [Sketcher Solver](#Sketcher_Solver).

Stable
:   A nickname for the last general release version of the FreeCAD software. This is typically the version available from sources other than the FreeCAD project. Compare with [Unstable](#Unstable).

STL
:   *STereoLithography*, also known as *Standard Tessellation Language.* A [mesh](#Mesh) file format defining only the surface of a 3D object. File extensions is \*.stl

STEP
:   An ISO standard (ISO 10303) for the exchange of 3D data and product manufacturing information. It replaces [IGES](#IGES). File extensions are \*.step, \*.stp.

SVG
:   [**S**calable **V**ector **G**raphics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics). A vector graphics file format.

Sweep
:   A 3D shape generated from at least one 2D cross-section that traces along a trajectory (path). Commonly used to define the tool as well as the created shape. See [Solid modeling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid_modeling#Sweeping)

Task panel
:   See [Tasks tab](#Tasks_tab).

Tasks tab
:   A [control panel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panel_(computer_software)) in FreeCAD that displays content specific to the task at hand. It can show available tools in the active [workbench](#Workbench) or prompt for values and options while a [command](#Command) is active.

Tessellation
:   A tessellation of a surface is the tiling of the surface using one or more geometric shapes, called tiles, with no overlaps and no gaps. In FreeCAD it is needed to display the geometric shapes in the 3D-view. The tessellation relative to the dimensions of a shape can be set in the preferences to get a smoother view of round surfaces at the cost of computation time. See [Preferences Editor](/Preferences_Editor "Preferences Editor").

Thickness
:   1.  A measure of how thick a shape is.
:   2.  A [Part](/Part_Workbench "Part Workbench") [workbench](#Workbench) tool to hollow out a solid and leave a defined uniform thickness.

Toggle
:   A setting that can be changed between two options, for example between True or False or between Off and On.

Topological Naming
:   A scheme whereby an edge or face, once created, is assigned a permanent name. Internally, FreeCAD identifies edges and faces on a solid by numbering them such as: Edge1, Edge2, Face1, Face2, etc. The problem is that these IDs are somewhat randomly applied, and they will change after something is done to the model that changes the amount of edges and faces. For example, if the model is revised an item linked to a Face2 could later erroneously become linked to a different face (which was renamed to become the new Face2), causing the user unwanted results. As of the FreeCAD 0.17 release Topological Naming has not yet been implemented, and so if an object is modified such that the number of edges or faces changes, the names of the edges or faces of that object might change too.

Torus
:   A primitive shape.

Tracker
:   Short for bug tracker, the online software application used to keep track of reported bugs or feature requests. See also [Mantis](#Mantis).

Union
:   A [Part](/Part_Workbench "Part Workbench") [workbench](#Workbench) tool that performs a [Boolean operation](#Boolean_Operation) on selected shapes.

:   A nickname for a very recent version of the FreeCAD software. This version will contain many changes recently implemented by the developers. It does not typically fail or produce wrong results, but it has not completed testing.

:   A [Draft](/Draft_Workbench "Draft Workbench") [workbench](#Workbench) tool.
