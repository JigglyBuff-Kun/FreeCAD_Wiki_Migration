## Usage

1. Press the ![](/images/PartDesign_AdditiveBox.svg) **Additive Box** button. **Note**: the Additive Box is part of an icon menu labelled *Create an additive primitive*. After launching FreeCAD, the Additive Box is the one displayed in the toolbar. If a different primitive is displayed, click on the down arrow besides the icon and select Additive Box in the menu.
2. Set the Primitive parameters and [Attachment](/Part_EditAttachment "Part EditAttachment").
3. Click OK.
4. A Box feature appears under the active Body.

## Options

The Box can be edited after its creation in two ways:

* Double-clicking it in the Model tree, or by right-clicking and selecting **Edit primitive** in the contextual menu; this brings up the Primitive parameters.
* Via the [Property editor](/Property_editor "Property editor").

## Properties

* Veri**Attachment**: defines the attachment mode as well as the Attachment Offset. See [Part EditAttachment](/Part_EditAttachment "Part EditAttachment").
* Veri**Label**: Label given to the Box object. Change to suit your needs.
* Veri**Length**: the Box's dimension in the X-direction.
* Veri**Width**: the Box's dimension in the Y-direction.
* Veri**Height**: the Box's dimension in the Z-direction.
