## Введение

This page provide a collection of hints and little guides on using the
![](/images/Workbench_TechDraw.svg) [TechDraw Workbench](/TechDraw_Workbench "TechDraw Workbench"). Adding new findings and best practices is encouraged.

### Enable/Disable Centermarks

When the centermarks are disabled hole centers and similar things can not be dimensioned. The centermarks are rendered as a little cross.

* Select the view port (e.g. "Front")
* In the property panel, 'View *Tab set the value* Arc Center Marks *to true*

*Note* in this tab are [other settings](/TechDraw_View#Properties "TechDraw View") for the view that might be useful.

### Toggle View Frame and Vertex dots

See [here](/TechDraw_ToggleFrame "TechDraw ToggleFrame") for switching them on and off and more information.

### Curved edges as input to linear dimensions

Curved edges are accepted as input to linear dimensions. See this [forum thread](https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=35&t=49719&start=30)
