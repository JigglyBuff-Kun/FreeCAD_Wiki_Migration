## Введение

In FreeCAD the word "[Model](/Model "Model")" is normally used to refer to any 3D object, or collection of objects, created in the [3D view](/3D_view "3D view").

That is, a "Model" can be anything created by the tools of FreeCAD, for example, the [PartDesign Workbench](/PartDesign_Workbench "PartDesign Workbench") or any of the other [workbenches](/Workbenches "Workbenches").

## Примечания

In informal usage, the word "[Drawing](/Drawing "Drawing")" may be used with the same meaning as "Model". However, when more precision is required, the distinction must be made.

* A "Model" is any 3D or 2D object created in the [3D view](/3D_view "3D view"), for example, a PartDesign [Body](/Body "Body"), or [Part](/Part "Part") containing many such Bodies.
* A "Drawing" is a strictly 2D projection of that "Model", usually created with the [TechDraw Workbench](/TechDraw_Workbench "TechDraw Workbench") tools. This "Drawing" is usually intended for printing or for export.
* The "Model" is usually the real object intended for manufacturing, while the "Drawing" is an auxiliary, flat representation of that "Model" which will be used for reference and documentation purposes.
