## Введение

The [Combo view](/Combo_view "Combo view") appears in a panel called **Model**. It combines the [Tree view](/Tree_view "Tree view") (upper section) and the [Property editor](/Property_editor "Property editor") (lower section).

The [Task panel](/Task_panel "Task panel"), which used to be part of the Combo view, is a separate panel called **Tasks** in 1.0 and above. It can be [docked](#Dock_Task_panel_on_top_of_Combo_view) on top of the Combo view to achieve the compact layout of earlier versions.

## Preferences

The Combo view is available if **Edit → Preferences... → General → General → Tree view mode** is set to `Combined`. If it is set to `Independent` the Tree view and the Property editor appear as separate panels.
