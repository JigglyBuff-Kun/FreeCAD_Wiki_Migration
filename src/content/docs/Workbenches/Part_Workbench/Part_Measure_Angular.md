## Description

This command measures the angle between two straight edges, two planar faces or one straight edge and a planar face and displays the measurement in the [3D view](/3D_view "3D view").

The appearance of the measurements can be changed in the [preferences](/PartDesign_Preferences#Measure "PartDesign Preferences").

## Usage

1. Select two straight edges, two planar faces or one straight edge
2. There are several ways to invoke the command:
   - Press the ![](/src/assets/images/Part_Measure_Angular.svg) [Measure Angular](/Part_Measure_Angular "Part Measure Angular") button.
   - Select the **Measure → ![](/src/assets/images/Part_Measure_Angular.svg) Measure Angular‏‎** option from the menu.
3. Alternatively the command can be launched without prior selection. A selection dialog then opens in the [Task panel](/Task_panel "Task panel"). A Control widget also provides buttons to reset the selection, toggle the measurement display in the [3D view](/3D_view "3D view"), and clear all measurements.
4. Measurements are automatically discarded when closing the document.

## Notes

- You cannot use the [Draft](/Draft_Workbench "Draft Workbench") snap tools with this command.
- To add dimensions to drawings use the dimension tools from the [TechDraw Workbench](/TechDraw_Workbench "TechDraw Workbench").
- For more comprehensive measuring tools, install the ![](/src/assets/images/Manipulator_workbench_icon.svg) [Manipulator Workbench](/Manipulator_Workbench "Manipulator Workbench") (an [external workbench](/External_workbenches "External workbenches")).
