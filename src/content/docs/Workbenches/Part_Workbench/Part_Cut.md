## Description

The ![](/images/Part_Cut.svg) **Part Cut** tool cuts (subtracts) selected Part objects, the last one being subtracted from the first one. This operation is fully parametric and the components can be modified and the result recomputed.

This tool is an automated form of the ![](/images/Part_Boolean.svg) [Boolean operation](/Part_Boolean "Part Boolean").

1. Select two shapes.
2. There are several ways to invoke the tool:
   - Press the ![](/images/Part_Cut.svg) [Cut](/Part_Cut "Part Cut") button.
   - Select the **Part → Boolean → ![](/images/Part_Cut.svg) Cut** option from the menu.

## Supported inputs
