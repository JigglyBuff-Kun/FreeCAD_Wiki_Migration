## Description

The ![](/src/assets/images/Part_Cone.svg) **Part Cone** command creates a parametric cone solid. In the coordinate system defined by its Data**Placement** property, the bottom face of the cone lies on the XY plane with its center at the origin.

The default Part Cone is truncated. It can be turned into a full, untruncated, cone by changing its Data**Radius1** or Data**Radius2** property to zero. It can be turned into a segment of a cone by changing its Data**Angle** property.

## Usage

1. There are several ways to invoke the command:
   - Press the ![](/src/assets/images/Part_Cone.svg) [Cone](/Part_Cone "Part Cone") button.
   - Select the **Part → Primitives → ![](/src/assets/images/Part_Cone.svg) Cone** option from the menu.
2. The cone is created.
3. Optionally change the dimensions and Data**Placement** of the cone by doing one of the following:
   - Double-click the object in the [Tree view](/Tree_view "Tree view"):
     1. The **Geometric Primitives** task panel opens.
     2. Change one or more properties.
     3. The object is dynamically updated in the [3D view](/3D_view "3D view").
     4. Press the OK button.
   - Change the properties in the [Property editor](/Property_editor "Property editor").
   - Change the Data**Placement** with the ![](/src/assets/images/Std_TransformManip.svg) [Std TransformManip](/Std_TransformManip "Std TransformManip") command.

Part Cone from the scripting example

A Part Cone object created with the [scripting example](#Scripting) below is shown here.

## Notes

- A Part Cone can also be created with the ![](/src/assets/images/Part_Primitives.svg) [Part Primitives](/Part_Primitives "Part Primitives") command. With that command you can specify the dimensions and placement at creation time.

## Properties

See also: [Property editor](/Property_editor "Property editor").

A Part Cone object is derived from a [Part Feature](/Part_Feature "Part Feature") object and inherits all its properties. It also has the following additional properties:

### Data

Attachment

The object has the same attachment properties as a [Part Part2DObject](/Part_Part2DObject#Data "Part Part2DObject").

Cone

- Data**Radius1** (`Length`): The radius of the bottom face of the cone. Can be `0mm` if Data**Radius2** is larger than `0mm`. The default is `2mm`.
- Data**Radius2** (`Length`): The radius of the top face of the cone. Can be `0mm` if Data**Radius1** is larger than `0mm`. The default is `4mm`.
- Data**Height** (`Length`): The height of the cone. The default is `10mm`.
- Data**Angle** (`Angle`): The angle of the circular arc that defines the top and bottom face of the cone. Valid range: `0° < value <= 360°`. The default is `360°`. If it is smaller than `360°` the resulting solid will be a segment of a cone.

## Scripting

See also: [Autogenerated API documentation](https://freecad.github.io/SourceDoc/), [Part scripting](/Part_scripting "Part scripting") and [FreeCAD Scripting Basics](/FreeCAD_Scripting_Basics "FreeCAD Scripting Basics").

A Part Cone can be created with the `addObject()` method of the document:

```
cone = FreeCAD.ActiveDocument.addObject("Part::Cone", "myCone")

```

- Where `"myCone"` is the name for the object.
- The function returns the newly created object.

Example:

```
import FreeCAD as App

doc = App.activeDocument()

cone = doc.addObject("Part::Cone", "myCone")
cone.Radius1 = 5
cone.Radius2 = 10
cone.Height = 50
cone.Angle = 270
cone.Placement = App.Placement(App.Vector(1, 2, 3), App.Rotation(30, 60, 15))

doc.recompute()

```
