## Description

The ![](/src/assets/images/Part_Box.svg) **Part Box** command creates a parametric box solid, a [rectangular cuboid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuboid#Rectangular_cuboid). In the coordinate system defined by its Data**Placement** property, the bottom face of the box lies on the XY plane with its front left corner at the origin, and its front edge parallel to the X axis.

## Usage

1. There are several ways to invoke the command:
   - Press the ![](/src/assets/images/Part_Box.svg) [Cube](/Part_Box "Part Box") button.
   - Select the **Part → Primitives → ![](/src/assets/images/Part_Box.svg) Cube** option from the menu.
2. The box is created.
3. Optionally change the dimensions and Data**Placement** of the box by doing one of the following:
   - Double-click the object in the [Tree view](/Tree_view "Tree view"):
     1. The **Geometric Primitives** task panel opens.
     2. Change one or more properties.
     3. The object is dynamically updated in the [3D view](/3D_view "3D view").
     4. Press the OK button.
   - Change the properties in the [Property editor](/Property_editor "Property editor").
   - Change the Data**Placement** with the ![](/src/assets/images/Std_TransformManip.svg) [Std TransformManip](/Std_TransformManip "Std TransformManip") command.

## Example

Part Box from the scripting example

A Part Box object created with the [scripting example](#Scripting) below is shown here.

## Notes

- A Part Box can also be created with the ![](/src/assets/images/Part_Primitives.svg) [Part Primitives](/Part_Primitives "Part Primitives") command. With that command you can specify the dimensions and placement at creation time.

## Properties

See also: [Property editor](/Property_editor "Property editor").

A Part Box object is derived from a [Part Feature](/Part_Feature "Part Feature") object and inherits all its properties. It also has the following additional properties:

### Data

Attachment

The object has the same attachment properties as a [Part Part2DObject](/Part_Part2DObject#Data "Part Part2DObject").

Box

- Data**Length** (`Length`): The length of the box. This is the dimension in its X direction. The default is `10mm`.
- Data**Width** (`Length`): The width of the box. This is the dimension in its Y direction. The default is `10mm`.
- Data**Height** (`Length`): The height of the box. This is dimension in its Z direction. The default is `10mm`.

## Scripting

See also: [Autogenerated API documentation](https://freecad.github.io/SourceDoc/), [Part scripting](/Part_scripting "Part scripting") and [FreeCAD Scripting Basics](/FreeCAD_Scripting_Basics "FreeCAD Scripting Basics").

A Part Box can be created with the `addObject()` method of the document:

```
box = FreeCAD.ActiveDocument.addObject("Part::Box", "myBox")

```

- Where `"myBox"` is the name for the object.
- The function returns the newly created object.

Example:

```
import FreeCAD as App

doc = App.activeDocument()

box = doc.addObject("Part::Box", "myBox")
box.Length = 4
box.Width = 8
box.Height = 12
box.Placement = App.Placement(App.Vector(1, 2, 3), App.Rotation(75, 60, 30))

doc.recompute()

```
