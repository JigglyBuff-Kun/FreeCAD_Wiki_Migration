## Description

The ![](/images/Part_Tube.svg) **Part Tube** command creates a parametric tube solid. In the coordinate system defined by its Data**Placement** property, the bottom face of the tube lies on the XY plane with its center at the origin.

## Usage

### Create

1. There are several ways to invoke the command:
   - Press the ![](/images/Part_Tube.svg) [Create tube](/Part_Tube "Part Tube") button.
   - Select the **Part → Primitives → ![](/images/Part_Tube.svg) Create tube** option from the menu.
2. The **Tube** task panel opens and a preview of the tube is displayed in the [3D view](/3D_view "3D view").
3. Specify the dimensions.
4. The preview is dynamically updated.
5. Press the OK button.
6. The tube is created.
7. Optionally change the Data**Placement** of the tube in the [Property editor](/Property_editor "Property editor"), or with the ![](/images/Std_TransformManip.svg) [Std TransformManip](/Std_TransformManip "Std TransformManip") command.

### Edit

1. Double-click the tube in the [Tree view](/Tree_view "Tree view")
2. The **Tube** task panel opens.
3. Change one or more dimensions.
4. The tube is dynamically updated in the [3D view](/3D_view "3D view").
5. Press the OK button.

## Example

Part Tube from the scripting example

A Part Tube object created with the [scripting example](#Scripting) below is shown here.

## Properties

See also: [Property editor](/Property_editor "Property editor").

A Part Tube object is derived from a [Part Feature](/Part_Feature "Part Feature") object and inherits all its properties. It also has the following additional properties:

### Data

Attachment

The object has the same attachment properties as a [Part Part2DObject](/Part_Part2DObject#Data "Part Part2DObject").

Tube

- Data**Height** (`Length`): The height of the tube. The default is `10mm`.
- Data**Inner Radius** (`Length`): The inner radius of the tube. Must be smaller than Data**Outer Radius**. Can be `0`. The default is `2mm`.
- Data**Outer Radius** (`Length`): The outer radius of the tube. Must be larger than Data**Inner Radius**. The default is `5mm`.

## Scripting

See also: [Autogenerated API documentation](https://freecad.github.io/SourceDoc/), [Part scripting](/Part_scripting "Part scripting") and [FreeCAD Scripting Basics](/FreeCAD_Scripting_Basics "FreeCAD Scripting Basics").

A Part Tube can be created with the `addTube()` method ([introduced in 0.20](/Release_notes_0.20 "Release notes 0.20")) of the Shapes module:

```
tube = Shapes.addTube(FreeCAD.ActiveDocument, "myTube")

```

- Where `"myTube"` is the name for the object.
- The function returns the newly created object.

Example:

```
import FreeCAD as App
from BasicShapes import Shapes

doc = App.activeDocument()

tube = Shapes.addTube(FreeCAD.ActiveDocument, "myTube")
tube.Height = 20
tube.InnerRadius = 2
tube.OuterRadius = 3
tube.Placement = App.Placement(App.Vector(2, 4, 5), App.Rotation(60, 60, 30))

doc.recompute()

```
