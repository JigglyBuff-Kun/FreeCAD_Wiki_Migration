## Description

The **Mesh Union** command creates a new non-parametric mesh object, a [Mesh Feature](/Mesh_Feature "Mesh Feature"), that is the union (fusion) of two mesh objects.

[OpenSCAD](http://www.openscad.org/) must be installed to use this command, and the path to its executable must be set in the [OpenSCAD preferences](/OpenSCAD_Preferences "OpenSCAD Preferences").

On the left two mesh objects, on the right the mesh object that is the union of those objects

## Usage

1. Select two mesh objects that partially overlap.
2. There are several ways to invoke the command:
   - Press the ![](/src/assets/images/Mesh_Union.svg) [Union](/Mesh_Union "Mesh Union") button.
   - Select the **Meshes → Boolean → ![](/src/assets/images/Mesh_Union.svg) Union** option from the menu.

## Properties

See: [Mesh Feature](/Mesh_Feature "Mesh Feature").
