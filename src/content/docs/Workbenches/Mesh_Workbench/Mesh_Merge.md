## Description

The **Mesh Merge** command creates a new non-parametric mesh object, a [Mesh Feature](/Mesh_Feature "Mesh Feature"), by combining the meshes of two or more mesh objects. The command does not perform a Boolean union, the new object will contain separate mesh components. For a Boolean union use the [Mesh Union](/Mesh_Union "Mesh Union") command instead. This command is the counterpart of the [Mesh SplitComponents](/Mesh_SplitComponents "Mesh SplitComponents") command.

## Usage

1. Select two or more mesh objects.
2. There are several ways to invoke the command:
   - Press the ![](/src/assets/images/Mesh_Merge.svg) [Merge](/Mesh_Merge "Mesh Merge") button.
   - Select the **Meshes → ![](/src/assets/images/Mesh_Merge.svg) Merge** option from the menu.

## Properties

See: [Mesh Feature](/Mesh_Feature "Mesh Feature").
