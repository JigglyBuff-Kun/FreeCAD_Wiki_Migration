## Description

The **TechDraw Dimension** tool is the TechDraw equivalent of the [Sketcher Dimension](/Sketcher_Dimension "Sketcher Dimension") tool. It offers contextual dimensioning and thus can replace most of the other [dimension tools](/TechDraw_Workbench#Dimensions "TechDraw Workbench").

## Usage

1. Optionally preselect some geometric elements (vertices, edges or faces).
2. There are several ways to invoke the tool:
   - Press the ![](/src/assets/images/TechDraw_Dimension.svg) [Insert Dimension](/TechDraw_Dimension "TechDraw Dimension") button.
   - Select the **TechDraw → Dimensions → ![](/src/assets/images/TechDraw_Dimension.svg) Insert Dimension** option from the menu.
   - Use the keyboard shortcut: D.
3. The cursor changes to a cross with the tool icon.
4. If you have not yet selected an element: select one.
5. Depending on the selected element(s) a dimension is proposed.
6. Optionally select an additional element.
7. The proposed dimension is updated.
8. Optionally press the M key one or more times to cycle through other available dimensions, if any.
9. Do one of the following:
   - Click in an empty area of the page or within the view to confirm:
     1. The clicked point determines the location of the dimension.
     2. A dimension is added.
     3. This tool runs in continue mode: optionally keep creating dimensions.
   - To finish, right-click or press Esc.

## Limitations

- Currently the tool can only handle 2D references (geometry selected in the drawing).
