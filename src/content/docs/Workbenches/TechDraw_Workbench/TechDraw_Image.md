## Description

The **TechDraw Image** tool inserts a [bitmap](/Bitmap "Bitmap") image (PNG, TIFF, JPEG, etc.) from a file into the page as a view.

[introduced in 1.0](/Release_notes_1.0 "Release notes 1.0"): The [TechDraw View](/TechDraw_View "TechDraw View") tool can also create an Image View.

## Usage

1. If there are multiple drawing pages in the document: optionally activate the desired page by selecting it in the [Tree view](/Tree_view "Tree view").
2. Select the **TechDraw → TechDraw Views → ![](/src/assets/images/TechDraw_Image.svg) Insert Bitmap Image** option from the menu.
3. If there are multiple drawing pages in the document and you have not yet activated a page, the **Page Chooser** dialog box opens:
   1. Select the desired page.
   2. Press the OK button.

## Properties

See also: [Property editor](/Property_editor "Property editor").

An Image View, formally a `TechDraw::DrawViewImage` object, has the [properties](/TechDraw_View#Properties_Part_View "TechDraw View") that are common to all View types. It also has the following additional properties:

### Data

Image

- Data**Image File** (`File`): The file containing this bitmap.
- Data**Image Included** (`FileIncluded`): Embedded image file. System use only.
- Data**Width** (`Float`): The width of the cropped image in mm. Only used if View**Crop** is `true`.
- Data**Height** (`Float`): The height of the cropped image in mm. Idem.

### View

Image

- View**Crop** (`Bool`): Crop the image to Data**Width** x Data**Height**.

## Scripting

See also: [Autogenerated API documentation](https://freecad.github.io/SourceDoc/) and [FreeCAD Scripting Basics](/FreeCAD_Scripting_Basics "FreeCAD Scripting Basics").

The Image tool can be used in [macros](/Macros "Macros") and from the [Python](/Python "Python") console by using the following functions:

```
dvi = FreeCAD.ActiveDocument.addObject('TechDraw::DrawViewImage','TestImage')
rc = page.addView(dvi)
dvi.ImageFile = "pathToMy/imageFile.png"
dvi.Height = 200
dvi.Width  = 200

```
