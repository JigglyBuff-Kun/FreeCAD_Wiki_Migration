## Description

The **TechDraw WeldingSymbol** tool adds welding specifications to an existing leader line.

![](/images/TechDraw_WeldingSymbol_example.png)

Welding specification added to a leader line

## Usage

1. Select an existing [leaderline](/TechDraw_LeaderLine "TechDraw LeaderLine").
2. There are several ways to invoke the tool:
   - Press the ![](/images/TechDraw_WeldSymbol.svg) [Add Welding Information to Leaderline](/TechDraw_WeldSymbol "TechDraw WeldSymbol") button.
   - Select the **TechDraw → Symbols → ![](/images/TechDraw_WeldSymbol.svg) Add Welding Information to Leaderline** option from the menu.
3. A task panel opens.
4. Specify the welding symbols and accompanying text to be added to the leader line.
5. Press the OK button.

## Notes

- After creation a welding symbol can be edited by double clicking it in the [Tree view](/Tree_view "Tree view").
- There is a [preference parameter](/TechDraw_Preferences "TechDraw Preferences") for the default welding symbol directory. You can add your own symbols in a personal directory.

## Properties

### Weld Symbol

- Data**All Around**: Shows the _All Around_ symbol (circle) at the kink in the leader line.
- Data**Field Weld**: Show the _Field Weld_ symbol (flag) at the kink in the leader line.
- Data**Alternate Weld**: Offsets the lower symbol to indicate alternating welds.
- Data**Tail Text**: Text to be shown at the end of the leader line.

### Tile

Each individual symbol ("arrow side" and "other side") is represented by a "tile" object. A Welding Symbol has 1 or 2 tiles associated with it. Each of it has the following properties:

- Data**Tile Parent**: The parent Weld Symbol
- Data**Tile Row**: Row of the tile. 0 means above the line, -1 below the line. **Note:** If you change the row of one tile, you must also change the tile for the second side! This way you can flip the sides.
- Data**Tile Column**: Column of the tile. At the moment it is always 0, therefore the property is not editable.
- Data**Symbol File**: Directory and file name of the symbol's SVG file.
- Data**Symbol Included**: Directory and file name of the actual included symbol SVG file. (It is a temporary directory.)
- Data**Left Text**: Text to be displayed to the left of the SVG symbol.
- Data**Center Text**: Text to be displayed above/below the SVG symbol.
- Data**Right Text**: Text to be displayed to the right of the SVG symbol.

## Scripting

See also: [Autogenerated API documentation](https://freecad.github.io/SourceDoc/) and [FreeCAD Scripting Basics](/FreeCAD_Scripting_Basics "FreeCAD Scripting Basics").

The WeldingSymbol tool can be used in [macros](/Macros "Macros") and from the [Python](/Python "Python") console by using the following functions:

```
symbolName = "DrawWeldSymbol001")
symbolType = "TechDraw::DrawWeldSymbol"
App.activeDocument().addObject(symbolType, symbolName)
App.activeDocument().Page.addView(App.activeDocument().DrawWeldSymbol001)
App.activeDocument().DrawWeldSymbol001.Leader = myLeader
App.activeDocument().DrawWeldSymbol001.AllAround = True
App.activeDocument().DrawWeldSymbol001.FieldWeld = True
App.activeDocument().DrawWeldSymbol001.AlternatingWeld = True
App.activeDocument().DrawWeldSymbol001.TailText = "process text"

tileName = "DrawTileWeld001"
tileType = "TechDraw::DrawTileWeld"
App.activeDocument().addObject(tileType, tileName)
App.activeDocument().DrawTileWeld001.TileParent = App.activeDocument().DrawWeldSymbol001
App.activeDocument().DrawTileWeld001.TileRow = 0
App.activeDocument().DrawTileWeld001.TileColumn = 0
App.activeDocument().DrawTileWeld001.SymbolFile = fullPathToMySvgFile
App.activeDocument().DrawTileWeld001.LeftText = "left text"
App.activeDocument().DrawTileWeld001.RightText = "right text"
App.activeDocument().DrawTileWeld001.CenterText = "center text"

```

## Svg Symbol Tiles

Individual symbols are formed by 64x64 pixel SVG files. Additional symbols can be created in an SVG program like [Inkscape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inkscape) using one of the symbols supplied by FreeCAD as a template.

![](/images/Techdraw-WeldingSymbolLayoutArrow.svg)
![](/images/Techdraw-WeldingSymbolLayoutOther.svg)

- Individual symbols are formed by 64x64 (nominal) pixel SVG files. The tiles actually have a "border" of 4px. The border ensures that the leader line and symbol meet nicely.
- The symbol is drawn in black on a transparent background. The stroke width is 0.5mm.
- The leader passes below symbols for the arrow side (see image on the left) and above symbols for the "other" side (see image on the right).
- There is no particular naming standard other than to append "Up/Down" to the arrow/other side symbols.
