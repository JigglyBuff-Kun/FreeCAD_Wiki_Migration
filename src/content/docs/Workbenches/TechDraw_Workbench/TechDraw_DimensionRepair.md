## Description

The **TechDraw DimensionRepair** tool can adjust the 2D or 3D geometry references of a dimension. These references may become incorrect due to the "[topological naming problem](/Topological_naming_problem "Topological naming problem")" or Hidden Line Removal.

See [TechDraw LengthDimension](/TechDraw_LengthDimension#Limitation "TechDraw LengthDimension") for more on dimensions and the topological naming problem.

## Usage

1. Select the dimension to be corrected and, optionally, the new geometry references, points or edges, in the TechDraw View or in the [3D view](/3D_view "3D view").
2. There are several ways to invoke the tool:
   - Press the ![](/src/assets/images/TechDraw_DimensionRepair.svg) [Repair Dimension References](/TechDraw_DimensionRepair "TechDraw DimensionRepair") button.
   - Select the **TechDraw → Dimensions → ![](/src/assets/images/TechDraw_DimensionRepair.svg)Repair Dimension References** option from the menu.
3. The **Dimension Repair** task panel opens showing the selected dimension and the current geometry references.
4. Select new geometry references if you have not done so already.
5. Press the Replace References with Current Selection button.
6. Press the OK button to update the dimension.
7. If 3D references have been selected: optionally change the Data**Measure Type** property of the dimension to `True`.

## Scripting

See also: [Autogenerated API documentation](https://freecad.github.io/SourceDoc/) and [FreeCAD Scripting Basics](/FreeCAD_Scripting_Basics "FreeCAD Scripting Basics").

The TechDraw DimensionRepair tool cannot used in [macros](/Macros "Macros") or from the [Python](/Python "Python") console. Dimension reference properties can be updated using Python.
