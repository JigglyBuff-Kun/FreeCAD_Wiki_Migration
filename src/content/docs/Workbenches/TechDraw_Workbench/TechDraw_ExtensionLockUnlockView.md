   - Press the ![](/images/TechDraw_ExtensionLockUnlockView.svg) [Lock/Unlock View](/TechDraw_ExtensionLockUnlockView "TechDraw ExtensionLockUnlockView") button.
   - Select the **TechDraw → Extensions: Attributes/Modifications → ![](/images/TechDraw_ExtensionLockUnlockView.svg) Lock/Unlock View** option from the menu.
3. The Data**Lock Position** property of the view is toggled. Locked views have a red padlock icon ![](/images/TechDraw_Lock.svg) in the lower left corner.
