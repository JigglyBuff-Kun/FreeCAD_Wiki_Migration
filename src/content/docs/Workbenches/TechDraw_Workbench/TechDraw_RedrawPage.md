## Description

The **TechDraw RedrawPage** tool forces a page update despite any contrary settings of KeepUpdated (Page property), Update with 3D (parameter) or Allow Page Override (parameter).

## Usage

1. If there are multiple drawing pages in the document: optionally activate the desired page or select it in the [Tree view](/Tree_view "Tree view").
2. There are several ways to invoke the tool:
   - Press the ![](/images/TechDraw_RedrawPage.svg) [Redraw Page](/TechDraw_RedrawPage "TechDraw RedrawPage") button.
   - Select the **TechDraw → Page → ![](/images/TechDraw_RedrawPage.svg) Redraw Page** option from the menu.
3. If there are multiple drawing pages in the document and you have not yet selected a page, the **Page Chooser** dialog box opens:
   1. Select the desired page.
   2. Press the OK button.
