title: TechDraw Preferences
---

## Introduction

The preferences for the ![](/images/Workbench_TechDraw.svg) [TechDraw Workbench](/TechDraw_Workbench "TechDraw Workbench") can be found in the [Preferences Editor](/Preferences_Editor "Preferences Editor"). In the menu select **Edit â†’ Preferences...** and then **![](/images/Workbench_TechDraw.svg) TechDraw**. This group is only available if the TechDraw Workbench has been loaded in the current FreeCAD session.

There are seven pages: [General](#General), [Scale](#Scale), [Dimensions](#Dimensions), [Annotation](#Annotation), [Colors](#Colors), [HLR](#HLR) and [Advanced](#Advanced).

All preferences with _italic_ labels are default values for new drawing objects. They have no effect on existing objects.

This page has been updated for version 1.0.

## General

General preferences

### Drawing Update

- **Update With 3D (global policy)**: Whether or not pages are updated every time the 3D model is changed.
- **Allow Page Override (global policy)**: Whether or not a page's **[Keep Updated](/TechDraw_PageDefault#Properties "TechDraw PageDefault")** property can override the global **Update With 3D** parameter.
- **Keep Page Up To Date**: Keeps drawing pages in sync with changes of the 3D model _in real time_. This can slow down the response time.
- **Auto-distribute Secondary Views**: Automatically distributes secondary views for [projection groups](/TechDraw_ProjectionGroup "TechDraw ProjectionGroup").

## HLR

![](/images/Preferences_TechDraw_Page_HLR.png)

HLR preferences

HLR stands for _hidden line removal_.

- **Use Polygon Approximation**: Uses an approximation to find hidden lines. This is fast, but the result is a collection of short straight lines.
- **Show Hard Lines**: Shows hard and outline edges (visible lines always shown)
- **Show Smooth Lines**: Shows smooth lines. A smooth line is a line indicating a change between tangent surfaces, as in the transition from a flat surface to a [fillet](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fillet_(mechanics)>).
- **Show Seam Lines**: Show seam lines. A seam line is a boundary between faces.
- **Show UV ISO Lines**: Shows ISO lines. ISO stands for _isoparametric_. [Here is a description](https://knowledge.autodesk.com/support/alias-products/learn-explore/caas/CloudHelp/cloudhelp/2014/ENU/Alias/files/GUID-4CCDF144-DB4F-4BEB-BA5A-E69CED27F4B9-htm.html) what isoparametric lines (in fact curves) are.
- **ISO Count**: The number of ISO lines per face edge.

## Advanced

![](/images/Preferences_TechDraw_Page_Advanced.png)

Advanced preferences

- **Detect Faces**: If checked, TechDraw will attempt to build faces using the line segments returned by the hidden line removal algorithm. Faces must be detected in order to use [hatching](/TechDraw_Hatching "TechDraw Hatching"), but there can be a performance penalty in complex models.
- **Report Progress**: Issue progress messages while building View geometry. [introduced in 0.21](/Release_notes_0.21 "Release notes 0.21")
- **Use New Face Finder Algorithm**: If checked, the new face finder algorithm will be used instead of the original one. [introduced in 0.21](/Release_notes_0.21 "Release notes 0.21")
- **Auto Correct Dimension Refs**: If checked, an attempt is made to update dimension references when the model changes. [introduced in 0.21](/Release_notes_0.21 "Release notes 0.21")
- **Show Section Edges**: Highlights the border of the section cut in [section views](/TechDraw_SectionView "TechDraw SectionView").
- **Fuse Before Section**: Performs a fuse operation on the input shape(s) before Section view processing.
- **Switch Workbench on Click**: If checked, double-clicking on a page in the tree will automatically switch to TechDraw and the page will be made visible. [introduced in 1.1](/Release_notes_1.1 "Release notes 1.1")
- **Allow Crazy Edges**: Includes edges with unexpected geometry in results, e.g. zero lengths.
- **Validate Shapes**: If checked, input shapes will be checked for errors before use and invalid shapes will be skipped. It can be slower but may prevent crashes. [introduced in 1.1](/Release_notes_1.1 "Release notes 1.1")
- **Debug Section**: Dumps intermediate results during a Section view processing.
- **Debug Bad Shape**: If checked, shapes that failed validation will be saved as B-rep files for later analysis. [introduced in 1.1](/Release_notes_1.1 "Release notes 1.1")
- **Debug Detail**: Dumps intermediate results during a Detail view processing.
- **Overlap Edges Scrub Passes**: The number of attempts to remove overlapping edges returned by the Hidden Line Removal algorithm. A value of 0 indicates no scrubbing. Values above 2 are generally not productive. Each attempt adds to the time required to produce the drawing. [introduced in 0.21](/Release_notes_0.21 "Release notes 0.21")
- **Edge Fuzz**: Size of selection area around edges. The fuzz unit is approximately 0.1 mm, depending on your current zoom. The default is 10. Values in the 20-30 range will make it noticeably easier to select edges. Large numbers will cause overlaps with other drawing elements.
- **Mark Fuzz**: Selection area around center marks. The fuzz unit is approximately 0.1 mm, depending on your current zoom.
- **Max SVG Hatch Tiles**: The limit of SVG tiles with a size of 64x64 pixels used to hatch a single face. For large scalings one might get an error about to many SVG tiles, then one needs to increase the tile limit.
- **Max PAT Hatch Segments**: The maximum hatch line segments used when hatching a face with a PAT pattern.
- **Balloon Drag**: Modifier key for balloon drag can be changed from the default here to avoid conflicts with OS or navigation style key bindings. [introduced in 1.0](/Release_notes_1.0 "Release notes 1.0")
