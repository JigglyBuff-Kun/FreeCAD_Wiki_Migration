## Description

The **TechDraw Quadrant** tool adds three [cosmetic vertices](/TechDraw_CosmeticVertex "TechDraw CosmeticVertex") along the length of one or more selected edges. The vertices are placed at 25%, 50% and 75% of the length of the edges. For a circular edge this results in cosmetic vertices at 90°, 180° and 270°, in addition to its geometric vertex at 0°.

Cosmetic vertices at quadrant points of a circle

## Usage

1. Select one or more edges in a view. Any edge can be selected, not just circles.
2. There are several ways to invoke the tool:
   - Press the ![](/src/assets/images/TechDraw_Quadrants.svg) [Add Quadrant Vertices](/TechDraw_Quadrants "TechDraw Quadrants") button.
   - Select the **TechDraw → Add Vertices → ![](/src/assets/images/TechDraw_Quadrants.svg) Add Quadrant Vertices** option from the menu.

## Notes

- The created cosmetic vertices are not parametrically linked to the selected edges.
- To delete a cosmetic vertex select it and press Delete. [introduced in 1.0](/Release_notes_1.0 "Release notes 1.0")

## Properties

Cosmetic vertices have no properties of their own, as they are not document objects. They share color and size settings with regular geometry vertices.

## Scripting

See also: [Autogenerated API documentation](https://freecad.github.io/SourceDoc/) and [FreeCAD Scripting Basics](/FreeCAD_Scripting_Basics "FreeCAD Scripting Basics").

Cosmetic vertices are not accessible from [macros](/Macros "Macros") or the [Python](/Python "Python") console at this time. This snippet will remove all cosmetic vertices from the view.

```
v = App.ActiveDocument.View
v.clearCV()
App.ActiveDocument.recompute()

```
