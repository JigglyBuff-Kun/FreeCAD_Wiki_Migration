## Description

The **Points PolyCut** command cuts points from point clouds.

## Usage

1. During the command the [3D view](/3D_view "3D view") cannot be changed. It is advisable to properly align the 3D view first.
2. Select one or more point clouds.
3. There are several ways to invoke the command:
   - Press the ![](/images/Points_PolyCut.svg) [Cut point cloud](/Points_PolyCut "Points PolyCut") button.
   - Select the **Points → ![](/images/Points_PolyCut.svg) Cut point cloud** option from the menu.
4. Define a polygon in the 3D view.
5. Select an option from the 3D view context menu:
   - **Finish**: removes the points that are inside the polygon and finishes the command.
   - **Clear**: allows to define a different polygon.
   - **Cancel**: cancels the command.
