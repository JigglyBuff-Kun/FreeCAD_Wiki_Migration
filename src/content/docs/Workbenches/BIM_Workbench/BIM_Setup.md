## Description

The preferences system of FreeCAD, located under menu **Edit -> Preferences**, is very complex. The **BIM setup dialog** offers a simplified version of it, by gathering some of the preferences settings most commonly used for BIM work under one simple screen. Changing any of the preference options there has the same effect as changing the corresponding setting under Edit -> Preferences.

By hovering the mouse over each setting, you will be shown a tooltip explaining what it is used for, and the location of the corresponding setting in the general FreeCAD preferences system.
