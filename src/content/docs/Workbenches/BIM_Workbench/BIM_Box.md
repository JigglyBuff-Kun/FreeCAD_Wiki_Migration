## Description

![](/images/BIM_box_screenshot.png)

The **BIM Box** tool allows you to create a standard [Part Box](/Part_Box "Part Box"), but instead of creating the object and letting you specify its dimensions and position afterwards, like the original [Part Workbench](/Part_Workbench "Part Workbench") tool does, this tool allows you to place and define the box dimensions graphically when creating the object. Boxes are basic [cuboid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuboid) shapes, that can be used as a base of any other kind of BIM object later on.

## Usage

1. Press the ![](/images/BIM_Box.svg) [Box](/BIM_Box "BIM Box") button
2. Click a first point to define a first corner of the box. It can be any of the box corners
3. Click a second point to define a first edge of the box, starting from the first point
4. Click a third point to define a first face of the box, orthogonal to the first edge
5. Click a fourth point to define the extrusion distance of the first face, forming the final box
