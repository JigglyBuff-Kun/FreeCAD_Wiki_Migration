## Description

Inserts a waypoint from preselected objects into a trajectory.

## Usage

Depending on the used navigation style preselecting may vary.

- For example, when using [Blender navigation](/Mouse_navigation#Blender_navigation "Mouse navigation"), you can hover with the mouse cursor over an object to highlight (preselect) it.
- Make sure, a trajectory is selected in the [Tree view](/Tree_view "Tree view").
- Press W to insert this waypoint into the selected trajectory.

## Notes

Selectable objects are:

- Corners of solids
- Points inserted via the ![](/src/assets/images/Workbench_Draft.svg) [Draft Workbench](/Draft_Workbench "Draft Workbench")
- Endpoints of sketch-elements such as lines, arcs (sketch must be visible)
