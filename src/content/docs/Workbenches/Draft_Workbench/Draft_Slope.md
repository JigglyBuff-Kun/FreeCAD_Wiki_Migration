## Description

The ![](/images/Draft_Slope.svg) **Draft Slope** command slopes selected [Draft Lines](/Draft_Line "Draft Line") or [Draft Wires](/Draft_Wire "Draft Wire") by increasing, or decreasing, the Z coordinate of all points after the first one. It can also be used to flatten [Draft Wires](/Draft_Wire "Draft Wire"). Note that the slope is relative to the XY plane defined by the Data**Placement** of the objects.

On the left a horizontal Draft Line. On the right the same line with a slope value of 1 (angle is 45°)

## Usage

1. Select one or more [Draft Lines](/Draft_Line "Draft Line") and/or [Draft Wires](/Draft_Wire "Draft Wire").
2. There are several ways to invoke the command:
   - [Draft](/Draft_Workbench "Draft Workbench"): Press the ![](/images/Draft_Slope.svg) [Set slope](/Draft_Slope "Draft Slope") button.
   - Draft: Select the **Modification → ![](/images/Draft_Slope.svg) Set slope** option from the menu.
   - [BIM](/BIM_Workbench "BIM Workbench"): Select the **Utils → ![](/images/Draft_Slope.svg) Set slope** option from the menu.
3. Enter a **Slope** value. `0` means each segment is horizontal, `0.5` means the delta height for each segment is `0.5` times its length, etc. The value can also be negative.
4. Press Enter or the OK button to finish the command.

## Scripting

See also: [Autogenerated API documentation](https://freecad.github.io/SourceDoc/) and [FreeCAD Scripting Basics](/FreeCAD_Scripting_Basics "FreeCAD Scripting Basics").

There is no Python method to slope objects. To emulate the results of the Draft Slope command the `Points` property of wire objects has to be modified.
