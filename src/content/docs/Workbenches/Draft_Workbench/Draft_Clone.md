## Description

The ![](/images/Draft_Clone.svg) **Draft Clone** command creates linked copies, clones, of selected objects. The shape of a clone is parametric, it will update if its source object changes. But a clone does have its own position, rotation, and scale, and its own [View properties](/Property_editor "Property editor"). For [BIM](/BIM_Workbench "BIM Workbench") objects the command creates a special type of clone: an Arch clone.

The command can be used on 2D objects created with the [Draft Workbench](/Draft_Workbench "Draft Workbench") or [Sketcher Workbench](/Sketcher_Workbench "Sketcher Workbench"), but also on many 3D objects such as those created with the [Part Workbench](/Part_Workbench "Part Workbench"), [PartDesign Workbench](/PartDesign_Workbench "PartDesign Workbench") or [BIM Workbench](/BIM_Workbench "BIM Workbench"). Clones of 2D objects can be used in [PartDesign Bodies](/PartDesign_Body "PartDesign Body").

## Usage

1. Optionally select one or more objects.
2. There are several ways to invoke the command:
   - Press the ![](/images/Draft_Clone.svg) [Clone](/Draft_Clone "Draft Clone") button.
   - Select the **Modification → ![](/images/Draft_Clone.svg) Clone** option from the menu.
   - Use the keyboard shortcut: C then L.
3. If you have not yet selected an object: select an object in the [3D view](/3D_view "3D view").

## Notes

- The scaling of a Draft Clone can be changed in the [Property editor](/Property_editor "Property editor") or, [introduced in 1.1](/Release_notes_1.1 "Release notes 1.1"), by double clicking it in the [Tree view](/Tree_view "Tree view") and entering new values in the task panel that opens. The latter option is more efficient.

## Properties

See also: [Property editor](/Property_editor "Property editor").

An object created with the Draft Clone command is derived from a [Part Part2DObject](/Part_Part2DObject "Part Part2DObject"), a [Part Feature](/Part_Feature "Part Feature") object or, if an Arch Clone is created, from the object type of the source object. It inherits all properties from that object. A clone derived from one of the first two objects also has the following additional properties:

### Data

Draft

- Data**Fuse** (`Bool`): specifies if overlapping shapes in the clone are fused or not.
- Data**Objects** (`LinkListGlobal`): specifies the objects that are cloned.
- Data**Scale** (`Vector`): specifies the X, Y and Z scale factors.

## Scripting

See also: [Autogenerated API documentation](https://freecad.github.io/SourceDoc/) and [FreeCAD Scripting Basics](/FreeCAD_Scripting_Basics "FreeCAD Scripting Basics").

To create a clone use the `make_clone` method ([introduced in 0.19](/Release_notes_0.19 "Release notes 0.19")) of the Draft module. This method replaces the deprecated `clone` method.

```
cloned_object = make_clone(obj, delta=None, forcedraft=False)

```

- `obj` contains the objects to be cloned. It is either a single object or a list of objects.
- `delta` is the displacement vector to be applied to the clone.
- If `forcedraft` is `False` and `obj` contains a single [BIM object](/BIM_Workbench "BIM Workbench"), an Arch Clone is created. Set `forcedraft` to `True` to create a Draft Clone instead.
- `cloned_object` is returned with the clone object.

Example:

```
import FreeCAD as App
import Draft

doc = App.newDocument()

place = App.Placement(App.Vector(1000, 0, 0), App.Rotation())
polygon1 = Draft.make_polygon(3, 750)
polygon2 = Draft.make_polygon(5, 750, placement=place)

vector = App.Vector(2600, 500, 0)
cloned_object = Draft.clone([polygon1, polygon2], delta=vector)

cloned_object.Fuse = True

doc.recompute()

```
