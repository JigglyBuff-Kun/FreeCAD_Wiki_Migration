## Description

The **Std ViewFullscreen** command switches [3D views](/3D_view "3D view") to and from fullscreen mode. 3D views are automatically [undocked](/Std_ViewDockUndockFullscreen "Std ViewDockUndockFullscreen") for fullscreen mode.

## Usage

1. Activate the correct 3D view.
2. There are several ways to invoke the command:
   - Select the **View → Document window → ![](/src/assets/images/Std_ViewFullscreen.svg) Fullscreen** option from the menu. This option does not work if you want to switch off fullscreen mode and there are other docked 3D views.
   - Select the **Document window → ![](/src/assets/images/Std_ViewFullscreen.svg) Fullscreen** option from the 3D view context menu.
   - Use the keyboard shortcut: F11.

## Notes

- Multiple 3D views for the same document can be created with the [Std ViewCreate](/Std_ViewCreate "Std ViewCreate") command.
- 3D views can also be docked and undocked with the [Std ViewDockUndockFullscreen](/Std_ViewDockUndockFullscreen "Std ViewDockUndockFullscreen") command.
