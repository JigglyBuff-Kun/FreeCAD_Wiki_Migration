## Description

The **Std UserEditMode** command defines the edit mode to be used when an object is double-clicked in the [Tree view](/Tree_view "Tree view").

## Usage

1. In the menu go to **Edit → Edit mode** and select an edit mode.

## Available edit modes

### Default

The object will be edited using its default mode. This edit mode is defined internally to be the most appropriate for the object type. For example, it will be shape properties edition for [Part primitives](/Part_Primitives "Part Primitives") and [PartDesign features](/PartDesign_Feature "PartDesign Feature"), placement edition for [Part booleans](/Part_Boolean "Part Boolean"), etc.

### Transform

The object will have its placement editable with the [Std TransformManip](/Std_TransformManip "Std TransformManip") command.

### Cutting

This edit mode is implemented as available but currently does not seem to be used by any object.

### Color

The object will have the appearance of its individual faces editable with the [Part ColorPerFace](/Part_ColorPerFace "Part ColorPerFace") command.

## Notes

* Not all objects support all edit modes. If the selected mode isn't supported by the object, its default edit mode will be used instead.
