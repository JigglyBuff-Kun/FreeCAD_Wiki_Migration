## Description

The **Std TreeSyncPlacement** command toggles the [Tree view](/Tree_view "Tree view") SyncPlacement mode. If this mode is on, the Data**Placement** of objects is automatically adjusted when they are dragged and dropped from one container into another container with a different coordinate system, preserving their placement relative to the global coordinate system.

## Usage

1. There are several ways to invoke the command:
   - Click on the black down arrow to the right of the ![](/images/Std_TreeSyncView.svg) button and select the **Sync placement** option from the flyout. Note: the button image will change depending on the selected option.
   - Select the **View → TreeView actions → Sync placement** option from the menu.
   - Use the keyboard shortcut: T then 3.
