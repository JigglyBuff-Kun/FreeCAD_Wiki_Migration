## Description

The **Std ToggleFreeze** command toggles the freeze state of objects. A frozen object is not recomputed when the objects it depends on change. The freeze state of objects is not stored in the document.

## Usage

1. Select one or more objects.
2. Select the **![](/src/assets/images/Std_ToggleFreeze.svg) Toggle freeze** option from the [Tree view](/Tree_view "Tree view") context menu.
3. Frozen objects are marked with the command icon in the Tree view.
4. If objects have been thawed: optionally [recompute](/Std_Refresh "Std Refresh") the document.
