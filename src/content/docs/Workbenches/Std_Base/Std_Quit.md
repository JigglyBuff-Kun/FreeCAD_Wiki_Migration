## Description

The **Std Quit** command closes the FreeCAD application and optionally saves unsaved documents.

## Usage

1. There are several ways to invoke the command:
   - Select the **File → ![](/src/assets/images/Std_Quit.svg) Exit** option from the menu.
   - Use the keyboard shortcut: Alt+F4.
2. If there are unsaved documents a dialog box will prompt you to save them:
   - Press the Save button to save the active document. If required enter a filename first.
   - Press the Discard button to discard the active document and lose all changes.

## Options

- If there are multiple unsaved documents: check the **Apply answer to all** checkbox to avoid being prompted for each unsaved document separately.
- If there are unsaved documents: press Esc or the Cancel button to abort the command.
