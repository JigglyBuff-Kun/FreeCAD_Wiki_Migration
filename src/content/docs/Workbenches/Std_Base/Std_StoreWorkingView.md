## Description

The **Std StoreWorkingView** command stores the camera settings of the active [3D view](/3D_view "3D view") in its temporary working view. This view can be recalled with the [Std RecallWorkingView](/Std_RecallWorkingView "Std RecallWorkingView") command.

Each 3D view has its own working view. Storing a new working view will overwrite the existing working view of the active 3D view. When a 3D view is closed its working view is lost.

## Usage

1. Make sure a [3D view](/3D_view "3D view") is active.
2. There are several ways to invoke the command:
   * Select the **View → Standard views → Store working view** option from the menu.
   * Use the keyboard shortcut: Shift+End.

## Scripting

See also: [Autogenerated API documentation](https://freecad.github.io/SourceDoc/) and [FreeCAD Scripting Basics](/FreeCAD_Scripting_Basics "FreeCAD Scripting Basics").

To store the current camera settings of the active 3D view in a working view:

```
import FreeCADGui

FreeCADGui.runCommand("Std_StoreWorkingView", 0)

```
