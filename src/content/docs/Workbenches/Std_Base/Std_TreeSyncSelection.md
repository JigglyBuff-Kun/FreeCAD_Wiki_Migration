## Description

The **Std TreeSyncSelection** command toggles the [Tree view](/Tree_view "Tree view") SyncSelection mode. If this mode is on, selecting an object in a [3D view](/3D_view "3D view") will automatically expand the Tree view to show that object.

## Usage

1. There are several ways to invoke the command:
   - Click on the black down arrow to the right of the ![](/src/assets/images/Std_TreeSyncView.svg) button and select the **Sync selection** option from the flyout. Note: the button image will change depending on the selected option.
   - Select the **View → TreeView actions → Sync selection** option from the menu.
   - Use the keyboard shortcut: T then 2.

## Preferences

See also: [Preferences Editor](/Preferences_Editor "Preferences Editor").

The Tree view SyncSelection mode can also be set in the preferences: **Edit→ Preferences → General → Selection → Auto expand tree item when the corresponding object is selected in 3D view**.
