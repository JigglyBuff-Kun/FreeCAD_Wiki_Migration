## Description

The **Std AxisCross** command toggles the axis cross in the active [3D view](/3D_view "3D view").

The axis cross consists of three arrows representing the positive X, Y and Z axis of the global coordinate system. Their common start point is the origin of the global coordinate system.

## Usage

1. There are several ways to invoke the command:
   - Select the **View → ![](/images/Std_AxisCross.svg) Toggle axis cross** option from the menu.
   - Use the keyboard shortcut: A then C.

## Notes

- FreeCAD can display a smaller coordinate system indicator in the bottom right corner of 3D views: **Edit → Preferences... → Display → 3D View → Show coordinate system in the corner**. See [Preferences Editor](/Preferences_Editor#3D_View "Preferences Editor").
- The [Navigation Cube](/Navigation_Cube "Navigation Cube") also includes a coordinate system indicator.

## Preferences

See also: [Preferences Editor](/Preferences_Editor "Preferences Editor").

- The default for the axis cross can be changed: **Edit → Preferences... → Display → 3D view → Show axis cross by default**.

## Scripting

See also: [Autogenerated API documentation](https://freecad.github.io/SourceDoc/) and [FreeCAD Scripting Basics](/FreeCAD_Scripting_Basics "FreeCAD Scripting Basics").

Use the `setAxisCross` method of the View object to toggle the axis cross.

```
import FreeCADGui

view = FreeCADGui.ActiveDocument.ActiveView
view.setAxisCross(True)
view.hasAxisCross()

```
