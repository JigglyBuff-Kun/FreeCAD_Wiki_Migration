## Description

The **Std ViewZoomIn** command zooms in in the active [3D view](/3D_view "3D view").

## Usage

1. There are several ways to invoke the command:
   - Select the **View → Zoom → ![](/images/Std_ViewZoomIn.svg) Zoom In** option from the menu.
   - Use the keyboard shortcut: Ctrl++.

## Notes

- With almost all [mouse navigation styles](/Mouse_navigation "Mouse navigation") it is also possible to zoom with the scroll wheel of the mouse.

## Preferences

See also: [Preferences Editor](/Preferences_Editor "Preferences Editor").

- The zoom factor can be changed: **Edit → Preferences... → Display → Navigation → Zoom step**. This setting also affects scroll wheel zoom.

## Scripting

See also: [Autogenerated API documentation](https://freecad.github.io/SourceDoc/) and [FreeCAD Scripting Basics](/FreeCAD_Scripting_Basics "FreeCAD Scripting Basics").

Use the `zoomIn` method of the View object to zoom in. The `zoomOut` method is also available.

```
import FreeCADGui

view = FreeCADGui.ActiveDocument.ActiveView
view.zoomIn()

```
