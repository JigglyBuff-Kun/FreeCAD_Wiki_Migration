## Description

The **Std SelForward** command restores the next recorded [Tree view](/Tree_view "Tree view") selection. Note that selections are only recorded if [Tree RecordSelection mode](/Std_TreeRecordSelection "Std TreeRecordSelection") is switched on.

## Usage

1. There has to be a next Tree view selection.
2. There are several ways to invoke the command:
   - Click on the black down arrow to the right of the ![](/src/assets/images/Std_TreeSyncView.svg) button and select the **![](/src/assets/images/Std_SelForward.svg) Selection forward** option from the flyout. Note: the button image will change depending on the selected option.
   - Select the **View → TreeView actions → ![](/src/assets/images/Std_SelForward.svg) Selection forward** option from the menu.
   - Use the keyboard shortcut: S then F.
3. The next selection is restored.

## Notes

- Only [Tree view](/Tree_view "Tree view") selections are recorded. To record a selection made in the [3D view](/3D_view "3D view") a final object has to be added in the Tree view.
