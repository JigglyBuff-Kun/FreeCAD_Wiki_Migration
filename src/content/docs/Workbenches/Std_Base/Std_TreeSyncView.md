## Description

The **Std TreeSyncView** command toggles the [Tree view](/Tree_view "Tree view") SyncView mode. If this mode is on, selecting an object from a different document in the Tree view automatically activates that document’s last used docked [3D view](/3D_view "3D view").

## Usage

1. There are several ways to invoke the command:
   - Click on the black down arrow to the right of the ![](/src/assets/images/Std_TreeSyncView.svg) button and select the **Sync view** option from the flyout. Note: the button image will change depending on the selected option.
   - Select the **View → TreeView actions → Sync view** option from the menu.
   - Use the keyboard shortcut: T then 1.

## Preferences

See also: [Preferences Editor](/Preferences_Editor "Preferences Editor").

The Tree view SyncView mode can also be set in the preferences: **Edit → Preferences → General → Selection → Auto switch to the 3D view containing the selected item**.
