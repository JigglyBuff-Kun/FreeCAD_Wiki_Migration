## Description

The **Std CloseAllWindows** command closes all windows, thereby closing all documents.

## Usage

1. Select the **File → ![](/src/assets/images/Std_CloseAllWindows.svg) Close All** option from the menu.
2. If there are unsaved documents a dialog box will prompt you to save them:
   - Press the Save button to save the active document. If required enter a filename first.
   - Press the Discard button to discard the active document and lose all changes.

## Options

- When the dialog box is displayed: press Esc or the Cancel button to abort the command.
- If there are multiple unsaved documents: check the **Apply answer to all** checkbox to avoid being prompted for each unsaved document separately.

## Notes

- A document can also be closed by right-clicking it in the [Tree view](/Tree_view "Tree view") and selecting **Close document** from the context menu.

## Scripting

See [Std New](/Std_New#Scripting "Std New").
