## Description

The **Std BoxSelection** command selects objects from a user defined rectangular area, a box, in the [3D view](/3D_view "3D view").

## Usage

1. There are several ways to invoke the command:
   - Select the **Edit → ![](/src/assets/images/Std_BoxSelection.svg) Box selection** option from the menu.
   - Use the keyboard shortcut: Shift+B.
2. Do one of the following:
   - Drag a rectangle from left to right to select objects whose geometric center lies inside the rectangle.
   - Drag a rectangle from right to left to select objects whose bounding box is (partially) inside the rectangle, or touches it.

## Notes

- Use the [Std BoxElementSelection](/Std_BoxElementSelection "Std BoxElementSelection") command to box select faces instead of objects.
- This command cannot be used to select elements in a sketch. See [Sketcher Workbench](/Sketcher_Workbench#Selection_methods "Sketcher Workbench").
