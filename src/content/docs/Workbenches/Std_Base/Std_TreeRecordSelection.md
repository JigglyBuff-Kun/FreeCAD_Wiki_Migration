## Description

The **Std TreeRecordSelection** command toggles the [Tree view](/Tree_view "Tree view") RecordSelection mode. If this mode is on, each Tree view selection is stored for future use. With the ![](/src/assets/images/Std_SelBack.svg) and ![](/src/assets/images/Std_SelForward.svg) buttons you can go backwards and forwards through these selections and restore them.

## Usage

1. There are several ways to invoke the command:
   - Click on the black down arrow to the right of the ![](/src/assets/images/Std_TreeSyncView.svg) button and select the **Record selection** option from the flyout. Note: the button image will change depending on the selected option.
   - Select the **View → TreeView actions → Record selection** option from the menu.
   - Use the keyboard shortcut: T then 5.

## Preferences

See also: [Preferences Editor](/Preferences_Editor "Preferences Editor").

The Tree view RecordSelection mode can also be set in the preferences: **Edit→ Preferences → General → Selection → Record selection in tree view in order to go back/forward using navigation button**.
