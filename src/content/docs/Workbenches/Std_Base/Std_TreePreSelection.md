## Description

The **Std TreePreSelection** command toggles the [Tree view](/Tree_view "Tree view") PreSelection mode. If this mode is on, an object that the mouse is over in the Tree view will be pre-selectected (temporarily highlighted) in all [3D views](/3D_view "3D view") belonging to that object's document.

## Usage

1. There are several ways to invoke the command:
   - Click on the black down arrow to the right of the ![](/images/Std_TreeSyncView.svg) button and select the **Pre-selection** option from the flyout. Note: the button image will change depending on the selected option.
   - Select the **View → TreeView actions → Pre-selection** option from the menu.
   - Use the keyboard shortcut: T then 4.

## Preferences

See also: [Preferences Editor](/Preferences_Editor "Preferences Editor").

The Tree view PreSelection mode can also be set in the preferences: **Edit→ Preferences → General → Selection → Preselect the object in 3D view when mouse over the tree item**.
