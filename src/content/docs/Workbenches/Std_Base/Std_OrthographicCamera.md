## Description

The **Std OrthographicCamera** command switches the camera in the active [3D view](/3D_view "3D view") to orthographic view mode. In this mode, objects that are further from the camera do not appear smaller than those that are closer.

## Usage

1. There are several ways to invoke the command:
   - Select the **View → ![](/images/Std_OrthographicCamera.svg) Orthographic view** option from the menu.
   - Select the **![](/images/Std_OrthographicCamera.svg) Orthographic view** option from the Mini-cube menu of the [Navigation Cube](/Navigation_Cube "Navigation Cube").
   - Use the keyboard shortcut: V then O.

## Preferences

See also: [Preferences Editor](/Preferences_Editor "Preferences Editor").

- The camera type can be changed: **Edit → Preferences... → Display → 3D View → Camera type**. The selected type will be used for all 3D views of all opened documents and also for new documents.

## Scripting

See also: [Autogenerated API documentation](https://freecad.github.io/SourceDoc/) and [FreeCAD Scripting Basics](/FreeCAD_Scripting_Basics "FreeCAD Scripting Basics").

Use the `setCameraType` method of the View object to change to orthographic or perspective mode.

```
import FreeCADGui

view = FreeCADGui.ActiveDocument.ActiveView
view.setCameraType("Perspective")
view.setCameraType("Orthographic")
view.getCameraType()

```
