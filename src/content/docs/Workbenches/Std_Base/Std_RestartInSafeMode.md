## Description

The **Std RestartInSafeMode** command restarts FreeCAD in a _factory reset_ state for debugging. It temporarily disables user configurations, addons, themes and other customizations.

## Usage

1. Select the **Help → ![](/images/Std_RestartInSafeMode.svg)Restart in safe mode** option from the menu.
2. A warning dialog box opens.
3. Press the Yes button to confirm.
4. FreeCAD is restarted in safe mode.
5. Restart FreeCAD again to exit safe mode

## Notes

- Safe mode can also be invoked from the Command Line Interface (CLI) using the `--safe-mode` flag. See [Start up and Configuration](/Start_up_and_Configuration "Start up and Configuration").
