## Description

The **Std ToggleSelectability** command toggles the selectability of objects in [3D views](/3D_view "3D view").

## Usage

1. Select one or more objects.
2. There are several ways to invoke the command:
   - Select the **View → Visibility → ![](/src/assets/images/Std_ToggleSelectability.svg) Toggle selectability** option from the menu.
   - Select the **![](/src/assets/images/Std_ToggleSelectability.svg) Toggle selectability** option from the [Tree view](/Tree_view "Tree view") context menu or 3D view context menu.

## Notes

- The selectability of an object can also be changed through its related Data**Selectable** property in the [Property editor](/Property_editor "Property editor").

## Scripting

See also: [Autogenerated API documentation](https://freecad.github.io/SourceDoc/) and [FreeCAD Scripting Basics](/FreeCAD_Scripting_Basics "FreeCAD Scripting Basics").

The `Selectable` property of an object determines its selectability.

```
import FreeCADGui

obj = FreeCADGui.ActiveDocument.myObjectName

obj.Selectable = not obj.Selectable

```
