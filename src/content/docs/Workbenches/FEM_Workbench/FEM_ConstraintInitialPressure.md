## Description

Creates an initial pressure condition for a fluid flow analysis.

## Usage

1. There are several ways to invoke the command:
   - Press the ![](/src/assets/images/FEM_ConstraintInitialPressure.svg) [Initial pressure condition](/FEM_ConstraintInitialPressure "FEM ConstraintInitialPressure") button.
   - Select the **Model → Fluid boundary conditions → ![](/src/assets/images/FEM_ConstraintInitialPressure.svg) Initial pressure condition** option from the menu.
2. Enter an initial pressure value.
3. For a 3D analysis, select a 'solid' (body) from your model, for a 2D analysis select a face.

## Notes

For simple analyses, it is not necessary to specify the initial pressure, however also in these cases it is recommended as best practice.
