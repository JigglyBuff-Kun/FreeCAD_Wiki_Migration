## Description

This command is used to easily trigger the FEM solver. It is a simplified version of the ![](/src/assets/images/FEM_SolverControl.svg) [Solver job control](/FEM_SolverControl "FEM SolverControl") which enables more settings.

## Usage

1. Select the solver object in the [Tree view](/Tree_view "Tree view"), e.g. ![](/src/assets/images/FEM_SolverCalculixCxxtools.svg) [Solver CalculiX Standard](/FEM_SolverCalculixCxxtools "FEM SolverCalculixCxxtools").
2. There are several ways to invoke the command:
   - Press the ![](/src/assets/images/FEM_SolverRun.svg) [Run solver calculations](/FEM_SolverRun "FEM SolverRun") button.
   - Select the **Solve → ![](/src/assets/images/FEM_SolverRun.svg) Run solver calculations** option from the menu.
   - Use the keyboard shortcut: S then R.
