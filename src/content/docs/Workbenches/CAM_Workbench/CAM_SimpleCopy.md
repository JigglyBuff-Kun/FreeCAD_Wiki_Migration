## Description

The tool ![](/src/assets/images/CAM_SimpleCopy.svg) [SimpleCopy](/CAM_SimpleCopy "CAM SimpleCopy") creates a non-parametric copy of a given path.

## Usage

1. Select one [CAM](/CAM_Workbench "CAM Workbench") object
2. Press the ![](/src/assets/images/CAM_SimpleCopy.svg) [Simple Copy](/CAM_SimpleCopy "CAM SimpleCopy") button

## Options

- The simple copy is not bound anymore to the path that was used to make the copy, and is not parametric. Therefore, when edited with the [CAM Inspect](/CAM_Inspect "CAM Inspect") tool, any change made to its G-code will be retained.
