## Description

The [Collada (DAE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COLLADA) format is a standard file format for exchange of Mesh data. The [BIM Workbench](/BIM_Workbench "BIM Workbench") can import meshes from .dae files, and export BIM and other [Shape](/Part_Workbench "Part Workbench")-based objects to the .dae format.

Note that imported objects will be [Mesh](/Mesh_Workbench "Mesh Workbench") objects, and will need to be turned into [Shapes](/Shape "Shape") or BIM objects for optimal use. The [BIM Workbench](/BIM_Workbench "BIM Workbench") has several tools to help you in performing that operation.

The Collada import functionality in the BIM workbench depends on [pycollada](http://pycollada.github.io/). If it is not installed on your system, Collada import/export will be disabled.
