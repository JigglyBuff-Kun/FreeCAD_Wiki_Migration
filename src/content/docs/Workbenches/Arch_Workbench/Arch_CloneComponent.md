## Description

The ![](/src/assets/images/Arch_CloneComponent.svg) [Arch Clone Component](/Arch_CloneComponent "Arch CloneComponent") produces ![](/src/assets/images/Arch_Component.svg) [Arch Components](/Arch_Component "Arch Component") that are clones of selected Arch objects.

**Unlike** the ![](/src/assets/images/Draft_Clone.svg) [Draft Clone](/Draft_Clone "Draft Clone") tool, which will produce a clone of the same type as the selected object, this tool produces a generic ![](/src/assets/images/Arch_Component.svg) [Arch Component](/Arch_Component "Arch Component") object that can assume any role, not necessarily the role of the cloned object.

The clone component will simply have its Data**CloneOf** property set to the selected object.
