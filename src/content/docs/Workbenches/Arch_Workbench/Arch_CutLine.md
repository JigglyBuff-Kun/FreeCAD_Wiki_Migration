## Description

The **Arch CutLine** tool cuts a solid Arch object like an [Arch Wall](/Arch_Wall "Arch Wall") or [Arch Structure](/Arch_Structure "Arch Structure") with a straight edge. Based on that edge and the normal of the [Draft working plane](/Draft_SelectPlane "Draft SelectPlane") a cutting face is generated.

[Arch Wall](/Arch_Wall "Arch Wall") cut by a line. Left: subtractive box that appears when using the tool. Right: resulting wall after the cut is done.

## Usage

1. If required align the working plane:
   - The selected edge may not be parallel to the normal of the working plane.
   - The generated cutting face will be perpendicular to the working plane.
2. Select the object to be cut in the [Tree view](/Tree_view "Tree view") or the [3D view](/3D_view "3D view").
3. Select a straight edge. This must be selected in the [3D view](/3D_view "3D view").
4. Press the ![](/src/assets/images/Arch_CutLine.svg) [Cut with line](/Arch_CutLine "Arch CutLine") button.
5. Choose **Behind** or **Front** to indicate on which side of the cutting face material should be removed.
6. Press the OK button.
