   - Select a [coincident point](/Sketcher_ConstrainCoincident "Sketcher ConstrainCoincident") connecting two B-splines or other edges.
2. There are several ways to invoke the tool:
   - Press the ![](/src/assets/images/Sketcher_JoinCurves.svg) [Join curves](/Sketcher_JoinCurves "Sketcher JoinCurves") button.
   - Select the **Sketch → Sketcher B-spline tools → ![](/src/assets/images/Sketcher_JoinCurves.svg) Join curves** option from the menu.
