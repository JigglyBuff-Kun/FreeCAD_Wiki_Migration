## Description

The ![](/src/assets/images/Sketcher_DeleteAllGeometry.svg) [Sketcher DeleteAllGeometry](/Sketcher_DeleteAllGeometry "Sketcher DeleteAllGeometry") tool deletes all geometry and all constraints from the sketch.

## Usage

1. There are several ways to invoke the tool:
   - Select the **Sketch → Sketcher tools → ![](/src/assets/images/Sketcher_DeleteAllGeometry.svg) Delete all geometry** option from the menu.
   - [introduced in 1.0](/Release_notes_1.0 "Release notes 1.0"): Right-click in the [3D view](/3D_view "3D view") and select the **![](/src/assets/images/Sketcher_DeleteAllGeometry.svg) Delete all geometry** option from the context menu (not available if there is a selection).
