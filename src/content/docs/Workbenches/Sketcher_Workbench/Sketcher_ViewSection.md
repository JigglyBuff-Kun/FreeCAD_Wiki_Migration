## Description

The ![](/images/Sketcher_ViewSection.svg) [Sketcher ViewSection](/Sketcher_ViewSection "Sketcher ViewSection") tool toggles a temporary section plane that hides any objects and parts of objects in front of the sketch plane while the sketch is in edit mode. This is a per-sketch setting stored in the View**Section View** property of sketches.
