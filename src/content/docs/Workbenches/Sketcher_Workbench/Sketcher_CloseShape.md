## Description

This tool can be used to make a selected contour in sketcher closed by making an endpoint of a sketcher element coincident with the endpoint of the sketcher element selected next.

## Usage

1. While editing a sketch, multi-select your unconnected sketcher elements in the [tree view](/Tree_view "Tree view") or in the [3D view](/3D_view "3D view")
2. Invoke the command several ways:
   - Press the ![](/images/Sketcher_CloseShape.svg) [Close shape](/Sketcher_CloseShape "Sketcher CloseShape") button.
   - Use the Z then W keyboard shortcut.
   - Use the **Sketch → Sketcher tools → ![](/images/Sketcher_CloseShape.svg) Close shape** entry from the top menu

## Notes

The tool will connect the elements in the order of their selection, so make sure to click and select in the correct order.
