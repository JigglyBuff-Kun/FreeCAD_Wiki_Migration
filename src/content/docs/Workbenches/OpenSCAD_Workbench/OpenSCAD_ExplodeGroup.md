## Description

This feature explodes a fusion or a compound back to single parts applying random colours to these parts.

## Usage

1. Select fusion/compound to be exploded
2. Click on ![](/src/assets/images/OpenSCAD_ExplodeGroup.svg) or choose OpenSCAD → ![](/src/assets/images/OpenSCAD_ExplodeGroup.svg) Explode Group from the top menu.

## Limitations

The feature works only on fusions/compounds consisting of:

- part primitives from Part Workbench
- extruded parts from Part Workbench
- revolved parts from Part Workbench

The feature will **NOT** work on:

- Pads/Revolution-parts from Part Design Workbench
- Arrays from Draft Workbench
