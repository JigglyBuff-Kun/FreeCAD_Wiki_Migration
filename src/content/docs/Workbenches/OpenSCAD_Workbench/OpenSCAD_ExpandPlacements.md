## Description

Expand all placements downwards in the Tree view.

## Usage

1. Select object in the [tree view](/Tree_view "Tree view").
2. Choose OpenSCAD → ![](/src/assets/images/OpenSCAD_ExpandPlacements.svg) Expand Placements from the top menu.

## Limitations

## Notes

This command "resets" the placement-values of an object, making the current position as 0/0/0.

Works with:

- Boolean objects
- Extruded objects (derived from the Part Workbench)
- Revolved objects (derived from the Part Workbench)
