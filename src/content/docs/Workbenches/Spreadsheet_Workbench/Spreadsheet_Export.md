## Description

The ![](/images/Spreadsheet_Export.svg) **Spreadsheet Export** tool exports a spreadsheet as a CSV file, which can be used in other applications. Note that the `tab` character, and not the `comma`, is the default field delimiter. But this can be changed in the [Spreadsheet Preferences](/Spreadsheet_Preferences "Spreadsheet Preferences") ([introduced in 0.20](/Release_notes_0.20 "Release notes 0.20")).

## Usage

1. Make sure there is an active [spreadsheet](/Spreadsheet_CreateSheet "Spreadsheet CreateSheet").
2. There are several ways to invoke the tool:
   - Press the ![](/images/Spreadsheet_Export.svg) [Export spreadsheet](/Spreadsheet_Export "Spreadsheet Export") button.
   - Select the **Spreadsheet → ![](/images/Spreadsheet_Export.svg) Export spreadsheet** option from the menu.
