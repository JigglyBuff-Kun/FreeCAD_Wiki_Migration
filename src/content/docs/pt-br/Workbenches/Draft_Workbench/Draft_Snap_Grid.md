## Utilização

For general information about snapping see [Draft Snap](/Draft_Snap "Draft Snap").

1. Optionally change the [working plane and/or the grid](/Draft_SelectPlane "Draft SelectPlane").
2. Make sure snapping is enabled. See ![](/images/Draft_Snap_Lock.svg) [Draft Snap Lock](/Draft_Snap_Lock "Draft Snap Lock").
3. If **Draft Snap Grid** is not active do one of the following:
   * Press the ![](/images/Draft_Snap_Grid.svg) [Snap grid](/Draft_Snap_Grid "Draft Snap Grid") button in the Draft snap toolbar.
   * [Draft](/Draft_Workbench "Draft Workbench"): Hold down the ![](/images/Draft_Snap_Lock.svg)![](/images/Toolbar_flyout_arrow.svg) button in the [Draft snap widget](/Draft_snap_widget "Draft snap widget") and in the menu that opens select the **![](/images/Draft_Snap_Grid.svg) Snap grid** option.
   * [BIM](/BIM_Workbench "BIM Workbench"): Select the **Snapping → ![](/images/Draft_Snap_Grid.svg) Snap grid** option from the menu, or from the [3D view](/3D_view "3D view") context menu.
4. Choose a Draft or BIM command to create your geometry.
5. Note that you can also change snap options while a command is active.
6. If required use [Draft ToggleGrid](/Draft_ToggleGrid "Draft ToggleGrid") to display the grid. The grid must be visible for this snap option to work.
7. Move the cursor near the intersection of two grid lines.
