## Descrição

The ![](/images/Draft_ToggleContinueMode.svg) **Draft ToggleContinueMode** command switches continue mode on or off. Many [Draft](/Draft_Workbench "Draft Workbench") and [Arch](/Arch_Workbench "Arch Workbench") commands support this mode. If continue mode is on they will restart after finishing. Continue mode can also be toggled in the task panel of those commands so in practice this command is rarely used.

## Utilização

1. Select the **Utilities → ![](/images/Draft_ToggleContinueMode.svg) Toggle continue mode** option from the menu.
2. Invoke a command that supports continue mode, [Draft Line](/Draft_Line "Draft Line") or [Arch Wall](/Arch_Wall "Arch Wall") for example.
3. To toggle continue mode in the task panel of the command: press T or click the **Continue** checkbox.
4. Create your geometry.
5. Press Esc or the Close button to finish the command and switch off continue mode.
