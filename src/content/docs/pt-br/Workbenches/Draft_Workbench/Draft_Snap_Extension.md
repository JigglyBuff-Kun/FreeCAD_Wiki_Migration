## Descrição

The ![](/images/Draft_Snap_Extension.svg) **Draft Snap Extension** option snaps to an imaginary line that extends beyond the endpoints of straight edges. The edges can belong to [Draft](/Draft_Workbench "Draft Workbench") or [BIM](/BIM_Workbench "BIM Workbench") objects but also to objects created with other [workbenches](/Workbenches "Workbenches").

Up to 8 edges can be referenced by this snap option and [Draft Snap Parallel](/Draft_Snap_Parallel "Draft Snap Parallel"), making it possible to snap to virtual intersections. Both snap options can also be combined with other snap options.

## Utilização

For general information about snapping see [Draft Snap](/Draft_Snap "Draft Snap").

1. Make sure snapping is enabled. See ![](/images/Draft_Snap_Lock.svg) [Draft Snap Lock](/Draft_Snap_Lock "Draft Snap Lock").
2. If **Draft Snap Extension** is not active do one of the following:
   * Press the ![](/images/Draft_Snap_Extension.svg) [Snap extension](/Draft_Snap_Extension "Draft Snap Extension") button in the Draft snap toolbar.
   * [Draft](/Draft_Workbench "Draft Workbench"): Hold down the ![](/images/Draft_Snap_Lock.svg)![](/images/Toolbar_flyout_arrow.svg) button in the [Draft snap widget](/Draft_snap_widget "Draft snap widget") and in the menu that opens select the **![](/images/Draft_Snap_Extension.svg) Snap extension** option.
   * [BIM](/BIM_Workbench "BIM Workbench"): Select the **Snapping → ![](/images/Draft_Snap_Extension.svg) Snap extension** option from the menu, or from the [3D view](/3D_view "3D view") context menu.
3. Choose a Draft or BIM command to create your geometry.
4. Note that you can also change snap options while a command is active.
5. Move the cursor over a straight edge.
6. The edge is highlighted.
7. If you now move the cursor beyond the endpoints of the edge, you will see a dashed line appear when the cursor is on the extended edge.
