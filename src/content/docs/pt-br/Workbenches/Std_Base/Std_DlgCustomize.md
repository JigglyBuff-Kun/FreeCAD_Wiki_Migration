The Customize dialog box

## Usage

1. The commands available in the Customize dialog box depend on the workbenches that have been loaded in the current FreeCAD session. So you should first load all workbenches whose commands you want to have access to.
2. There are several ways to invoke the command:
   * Select the **Tools → ![](/images/Std_DlgCustomize.svg) Customize...** option from the menu.
   * Right-click a toolbar area and choose **![](/images/Std_DlgCustomize.svg) Customize...** from the context menu.
3. The **Customize** dialog box opens. For more information see [Interface Customization](/Interface_Customization#Options "Interface Customization").
4. The Help button does not work at this time.
5. Press the Close button to close the dialog box.
