## Descrição

The **Std ViewFitSelection** command zooms and pans the camera so that all selected objects fit inside the active [3D view](/3D_view "3D view"). This command is useful if for some reason objects are beyond the boundaries of the current 3D View or can't easily be found using [3D navigation](/Mouse_navigation "Mouse navigation").

## Utilização

1. Select one or more objects.
2. There are several ways to invoke the command:
   * Press the ![](/images/Std_ViewFitSelection.svg) [Fit selection](/Std_ViewFitSelection "Std ViewFitSelection") button.
   * Select the **View → Standard views → ![](/images/Std_ViewFitSelection.svg) Fit selection** option from the menu.
   * Select the **![](/images/Std_ViewFitSelection.svg) Fit selection** option from the [3D view](/3D_view "3D view") context menu.
   * Select the **![](/images/Std_ViewFitSelection.svg) Fit selection** option from the Mini-cube menu of the [Navigation Cube](/Navigation_Cube "Navigation Cube").
