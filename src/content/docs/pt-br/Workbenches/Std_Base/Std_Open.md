## Descrição

The **Std Open** command opens a file. If the file is not a native FreeCAD file (\*.FCStd) its geometry will be imported into a new document. See [Std Import](/Std_Import "Std Import") for more information.

## Uso

1. There are several ways to invoke the command:
   * Press the ![](/images/Std_Open.svg) [Open...](/Std_Open "Std Open") button.
   * Select the **File → ![](/images/Std_Open.svg) Open...** option from the menu.
   * Use the keyboard shortcut: Ctrl+O.
2. Optionally select the correct file format in the dialog box.
3. Select a file.
4. Press the Open button.

## Opções

* Press Esc or the Cancel button to abort the command.

## Scripting

See also: [Autogenerated API documentation](https://freecad.github.io/SourceDoc/) and [FreeCAD Scripting Basics](/FreeCAD_Scripting_Basics "FreeCAD Scripting Basics").

To open a document use the `open(filepath)` method or the `openDocument(filepath, [hidden=False])` method of the FreeCAD application.

These methods create and return a document and load a project file into it. The `filepath` argument must be a string pointing to an existing file. If the file doesn't exist or the file cannot be loaded an I/O exception is thrown. In this case the created document is kept, but will be empty. If `hidden=True` is used, the document won't be displayed in the GUI and no tab will appear for it. This allows performing automatic operations on a document and closing it without disrupting the user interface.

For a scripting example see [Std New](/Std_New#Scripting "Std New").
