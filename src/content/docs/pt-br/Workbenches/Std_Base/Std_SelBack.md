## Descrição

The **Std SelBack** command restores the previous recorded [Tree view](/Tree_view "Tree view") selection. Note that selections are only recorded if [Tree RecordSelection mode](/Std_TreeRecordSelection "Std TreeRecordSelection") is switched on.

## Utilização

1. There has to be a previous Tree view selection.
2. There are several ways to invoke the command:
   * Click on the black down arrow to the right of the ![](/images/Std_TreeSyncView.svg) button and select the **![](/images/Std_SelBack.svg) Selection back** option from the flyout. Note: the button image will change depending on the selected option.
   * Select the **View → TreeView actions → ![](/images/Std_SelBack.svg) Selection back** option from the menu.
   * Use the keyboard shortcut: S then B.
3. The previous selection is restored.
