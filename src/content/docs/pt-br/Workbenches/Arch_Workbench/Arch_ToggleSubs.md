## Descrição

The **Arch ToggleSubs** tools toggles the visibility of all the subtractions of an [BIM](/BIM_Workbench "BIM Workbench") object between visible and hidden.

Normally, if an Arch object, like an [Arch Wall](/Arch_Wall "Arch Wall"), is selected and you press Space only the external wall will be hidden or made visible, but not the internal objects.

With this tool, the internal subtracted objects will all become visible or hidden.

## Utilização

1. Select an Arch object that has subtractions.
2. Select the **Utils → ![](/images/Arch_ToggleSubs.svg) Toggle subcomponents** option from the menu.

## Opções

The color of a subtraction element can follow the style of [Draft construction](/Draft_ToggleConstructionMode "Draft ToggleConstructionMode") elements, by activating the appropriate option in the [Arch Preferences](/Arch_Preferences "Arch Preferences"), in the menu **Edit → Preferences → Arch → General settings → Apply Draft construction style to subcomponents**.

The [Draft construction](/Draft_ToggleConstructionMode "Draft ToggleConstructionMode") style can be set in the [Draft Preferences](/Draft_Preferences "Draft Preferences"), in the menu **Preferences → Draft → General Draft**.
