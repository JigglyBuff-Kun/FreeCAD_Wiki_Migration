## Descrição

The **BIM IfcExplorer** is a simple utility to explore the contents of an [IFC](/Arch_IFC "Arch IFC") file. IFC files are text files, and are therefore readable in a text editor, but the information is condensed, unformatted, and difficult to browse. This utility presents to the user the exact same content, but displayed in an organized and readable method. The "[IfcOpenShell](/IfcOpenShell "IfcOpenShell")" software library must be installed for this utility to work.

The purpose of this explorer is simply to allow you to check what is really written in an IFC file, in case you want to verify if the contents were correctly imported or exported to and from an IFC-aware application such as FreeCAD.
