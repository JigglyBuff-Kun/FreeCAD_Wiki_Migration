## Descrição

The ![](/images/Sketcher_ViewSketch.svg) [Sketcher ViewSketch](/Sketcher_ViewSketch "Sketcher ViewSketch") tool aligns the [3D view](/3D_view "3D view") with the sketch. The view is rotated so that the view direction is perpendicular to the sketch plane, and the X axis of the sketch appears horizontal. It is useful if you have changed the view orientation to examine another aspect of the model and want to return to the default sketch view.

## Utilização
