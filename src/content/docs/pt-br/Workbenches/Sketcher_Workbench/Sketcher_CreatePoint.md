## Description

The ![](/images/Sketcher_CreatePoint.svg) [Sketcher CreatePoint](/Sketcher_CreatePoint "Sketcher CreatePoint") tool creates a point.

## Usage

See also: [Drawing aids](/Sketcher_Workbench#Drawing_aids "Sketcher Workbench").

Pos-OVP = Positional [On-View-Parameters](/Sketcher_Preferences#General "Sketcher Preferences"). [introduced in 1.0](/Release_notes_1.0 "Release notes 1.0")

1. There are several ways to invoke the tool:
   * Press the ![](/images/Sketcher_CreatePoint.svg) [Create point](/Sketcher_CreatePoint "Sketcher CreatePoint") button.
   * Select the **Sketcher → Sketcher geometries → ![](/images/Sketcher_CreatePoint.svg) Create point** option from the menu.
   * Right-click in the [3D view](/3D_view "3D view") and select the **![](/images/Sketcher_CreatePoint.svg) Create point** option from the context menu.
   * Use the keyboard shortcut: G then Y.
2. The cursor changes to a cross with the tool icon.
3. Pick a point. Or with Pos-OVP: enter its X and/or Y coordinate.
4. The point is created and applicable Pos-OVP based constraints are added.
5. If the tool runs in [continue mode](/Sketcher_Workbench#Continue_modes "Sketcher Workbench"):
   1. Optionally keep creating points.
   2. To finish, right-click or press Esc, or start another geometry or constraint creation tool.

## Notes

* 0.21 and below: Points are always created as construction geometry. Optionally change them to normal geometry with [Sketcher ToggleConstruction](/Sketcher_ToggleConstruction "Sketcher ToggleConstruction") to make them visible outside of Sketch editing mode.
