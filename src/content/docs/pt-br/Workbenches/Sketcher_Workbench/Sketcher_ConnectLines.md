## Description

Applies [Coincident constraints](/Sketcher_ConstrainCoincident "Sketcher ConstrainCoincident") to endpoints with the same coordinates of the selected elements.

## Usage

1. Select the unconnected elements in the [3D view](/3D_view "3D view") or in the [Task panel](/Task_panel "Task panel") on the left side of the screen
2. Invoke the command using several methods:
   * Press the ![](/images/Sketcher_ConnectLines.svg) [Connect edges](/Sketcher_ConnectLines "Sketcher ConnectLines") button.
   * Use the Z then J keyboard shortcut.
   * Use the **Sketch → Sketcher tools → ![](/images/Sketcher_ConnectLines.svg) Connect edges** entry from the top menu.

## Notes

Before using this command make sure that obvious constraints (horizontal, vertical, tangential) are already applied to the elements.
Selecting the elements in a counter-clock-wise order seems to produce better results.
