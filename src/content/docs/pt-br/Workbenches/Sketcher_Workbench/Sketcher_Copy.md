## Description

The ![](/images/Sketcher_Copy.svg) [Sketcher Copy](/Sketcher_Copy "Sketcher Copy") command copies the selected sketch elements from one point to another, using the last selected point as reference. When a copy is made, there is no link established between the copy and the original, see ![](/images/Sketcher_Clone.svg) [Sketcher Clone](/Sketcher_Clone "Sketcher Clone").

## Usage

1. Select sketcher element for copy operation.
2. There are several ways to invoke the command:
   * Press the ![](/images/Sketcher_Copy.svg) [Copy](/Sketcher_Copy "Sketcher Copy") button.
   * Select the **Sketch → Sketcher tools → ![](/images/Sketcher_Copy.svg) Copy** option from the menu.
   * The keyboard shortcut: Z then C.
3. Move the mouse in the [3D view](/3D_view "3D view") to the desired location for the copy.  
   By keeping Shift pressed, the angle to the location point can be fixed in steps of 5°. [introduced in 0.20](/Release_notes_0.20 "Release notes 0.20")
4. Left-click in the 3D view to create the copy.

No extra constraints are added.
