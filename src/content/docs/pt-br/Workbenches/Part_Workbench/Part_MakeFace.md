## Description

The ![](/images/Part_MakeFace.svg) **Part MakeFace** command creates a planar face from one or more coplanar closed wires (contours). They can be any valid wire, i.e. created with the [Part Workbench](/Part_Workbench "Part Workbench"), the [Draft Workbench](/Draft_Workbench "Draft Workbench") or the [Sketcher Workbench](/Sketcher_Workbench "Sketcher Workbench"). The contours should not self-intersect, or intersect each other. They can be nested to create voids.
