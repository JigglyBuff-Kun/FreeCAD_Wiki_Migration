## Description

Extracts the common part (intersection) between selected Part objects. This operation is fully parametric and the components can be modified and the result recomputed.

## Usage

1. Select two shapes
2. Press the ![](/images/Part_Common.svg) [Common](/Part_Common "Part Common") button.

## Supported inputs

Input objects must be [OpenCASCADE](/OpenCASCADE "OpenCASCADE") shapes. Examples: stuff made with Part, PartDesign, Sketcher workbenches. Not meshes (unless those were converted to shapes) - for meshes, there are specific Boolean tools in MeshDesign workbench.
