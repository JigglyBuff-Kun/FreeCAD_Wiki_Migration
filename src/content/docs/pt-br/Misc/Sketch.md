## Introdução

In FreeCAD the word "[Sketch](/Sketch "Sketch")" is normally used to refer to a [Sketcher SketchObject](/Sketcher_SketchObject "Sketcher SketchObject") (`Sketcher::SketchObject` class) that is defined by the [Sketcher Workbench](/Sketcher_Workbench "Sketcher Workbench"). This is a 2D drawing that uses mathematical constraints to describe 2D geometry precisely.

See [Sketcher SketchObject](/Sketcher_SketchObject "Sketcher SketchObject") for more information about this type of object.

## Usage

There are two common ways to create a Sketch: using the [Sketcher Workbench](/Sketcher_Workbench "Sketcher Workbench") directly, or through the [PartDesign Workbench](/PartDesign_Workbench "PartDesign Workbench").

### Sketcher Workbench

1. Switch to the ![](/images/Workbench_Sketcher.svg) [Sketcher Workbench](/Sketcher_Workbench "Sketcher Workbench").
2. Press ![](/images/Sketcher_NewSketch.svg) [Sketcher NewSketch](/Sketcher_NewSketch "Sketcher NewSketch").

### PartDesign Workbench

1. Switch to the ![](/images/Workbench_PartDesign.svg) [PartDesign Workbench](/PartDesign_Workbench "PartDesign Workbench").
2. Press ![](/images/PartDesign_Body.svg) [PartDesign Body](/PartDesign_Body "PartDesign Body").
3. Press ![](/images/PartDesign_NewSketch.svg) [PartDesign NewSketch](/PartDesign_NewSketch "PartDesign NewSketch").

After you finish editing the sketch, close it to go out of edit mode. Double click on it to enter edit mode again.

## Notes

A Sketch is very commonly used in conjunction with the ![](/images/Workbench_PartDesign.svg) [PartDesign Workbench](/PartDesign_Workbench "PartDesign Workbench") to create solids by extrusion, using the ![](/images/PartDesign_Pad.svg) [PartDesign Pad](/PartDesign_Pad "PartDesign Pad") operation.

Nevertheless, a Sketch can always be created by itself for any other purpose; it does not have to be tied to a [PartDesign Body](/PartDesign_Body "PartDesign Body"). For example, the ![](/images/Arch_Window.svg) [Arch Window](/Arch_Window "Arch Window") tool of the ![](/images/Workbench_BIM.svg) [BIM Workbench](/BIM_Workbench "BIM Workbench") uses Sketches to define the shapes of windows and doors; in the same way, they can be used to define the shape of ![](/images/Arch_Wall.svg) [Arch Walls](/Arch_Wall "Arch Wall").
