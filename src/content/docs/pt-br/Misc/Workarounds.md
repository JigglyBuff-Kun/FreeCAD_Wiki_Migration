The goal of this article is to list some currently missing features in FreeCAD and provide workarounds for them. It can be helpful for new users who can't find a particular functionality in FreeCAD.

## Soluções alternativas para a Bancada de trabalho Sketcher

| No. | Missing feature | Workarounds |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Auto snap to objects (geometric centers, quadrants, extensions, intersections) | * Manually apply [constraints](/Sketcher_Workbench#Sketcher_constraints "Sketcher Workbench") and use [construction lines](/Sketcher_ToggleConstruction "Sketcher ToggleConstruction") * Draw geometry in the [Draft Workbench](/Draft_Workbench "Draft Workbench"), where snapping to objects is available, then convert to sketch with the [Draft Draft2Sketch](/Draft_Draft2Sketch "Draft Draft2Sketch") tool |
| 2 | Check geometric and mass properties of the sketch (area, center of mass, second moments of area and so on) | * Create a face from the sketch with [Part MakeFace](/Part_MakeFace "Part MakeFace"), then analyze that face with [Part CheckGeometry](/Part_CheckGeometry "Part CheckGeometry") |
| 3 | Possibility to use the results of the [External Geometry](/Sketcher_External "Sketcher External") tool directly for operations on the sketch | * Manually trace over the geometry created by this tool * [Link Branch](https://github.com/realthunder/FreeCAD/releases) - Defining Geometry tool |
| 4 | Project multiple edges at once with the [External Geometry](/Sketcher_External "Sketcher External") tool when a face is selected | * Project edges individually |
| 5 | 3D sketches | * Use the [Draft Workbench](/Draft_Workbench "Draft Workbench"), but 3D drafts can't be converted to sketches (however, they can be used for spatial frame analyses done [internally](/FEM_Workbench "FEM Workbench") or externally, and for [PartDesign AdditivePipe](/PartDesign_AdditivePipe "PartDesign AdditivePipe") or [Part Sweep](/Part_Sweep "Part Sweep") paths) |
| 6 | Projection of cut edges when making a sketch on a plane cutting through an object | * Create a [Link](/Std_LinkMake "Std LinkMake") from the object, and [slice](/Part_SliceApart "Part SliceApart") that object to get actual cut edges |
| 7 | [View section](/Sketcher_ViewSection "Sketcher ViewSection") tool showing filled cuts | * If the sketch is plane-parallel to one of the main planes of the global coordinate system: use [Part SectionCut](/Part_SectionCut "Part SectionCut") |
| 8 | Diameter dimension with respect to a symmetry axis for revolved parts | * Create a radius dimension instead (you can enter the diameter divided by 2 - the calculation will be handled by FreeCAD) |
| 9 | Dimension labels adapting to the rotation of the view to be always readable | * Rotate the view when needed |
| 10 | First [dimension](/Sketcher_Workbench#Dimensional_constraints "Sketcher Workbench") in the sketch scaling the geometry so that its initially drawn shape is not broken | * Apply some [dimensional constraints](/Sketcher_Workbench#Dimensional_constraints "Sketcher Workbench") before drawing the entire shape |
| 11 | An option to hide the whole [construction geometry](/Sketcher_ToggleConstruction "Sketcher ToggleConstruction") in an active sketch | * In the Elements window, use the *Construction* filter, select the [construction geometry](/Sketcher_ToggleConstruction "Sketcher ToggleConstruction") entities there and uncheck their checkboxes |

| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Check the geometric and mass properties of the model | * [FCInfo macro](/Macro_FCInfo "Macro FCInfo") * [Part CheckGeometry](/Part_CheckGeometry "Part CheckGeometry") tool – area, volume, mass, length, center of mass, moments of inertia, radius of gyration |

| 3 | [Clipping plane](/Std_ToggleClipPlane "Std ToggleClipPlane") that doesn't make the model look like it's hollow | * Change the Lighting property in the part's view settings to "One side" (very rough equivalent, problem with multicolored parts) * [Persistent section cut](/Part_SectionCut "Part SectionCut") tool - deselect all planes before pressing Close * [Link Branch](https://github.com/realthunder/FreeCAD/releases) - experimental renderer |
| 4 | Creation of an axis on the intersection of 2 planes and a plane midway between two faces/points, possibly more variants for [datum](/Datum "Datum") creation | * [Macro Intersection](/Macro_Intersection "Macro Intersection") * Manual adjustment of [datum](/Datum "Datum") attachment |
| 5 | Automated midsurface extraction (for thin-walled parts) | * Use [Draft Facebinder](/Draft_Facebinder "Draft Facebinder") and then [Draft Scale](/Draft_Scale "Draft Scale") or [Part Offset](/Part_Offset "Part Offset") (easier) to make it actual midsurface, apply the workaround for extending faces if the generated midsurfaces are separated and join them with boolean tools |
| 6 | Project (map/wrap) sketches on non-planar (e.g. cylindrical) faces | * [Curves SketchOnSurface](/Curves_SketchOnSurface "Curves SketchOnSurface") tool in add-on [Curves Workbench](/Curves_Workbench "Curves Workbench") * [Part ProjectionOnSurface](/Part_ProjectionOnSurface "Part ProjectionOnSurface") tool |

Then it is possible to select these faces individually and pad them. This method should be used with caution since unnecessary 3D operations may lead to unexpected errors. Thus, it is recommended to use the previous workaround instead. * [Link Branch](https://github.com/realthunder/FreeCAD/releases) - Export Single Geometry and Export Multiple Geometries tools or automatic [SubShapeBinder](/PartDesign_SubShapeBinder "PartDesign SubShapeBinder") created when edges forming a closed loop are selected from the sketch before [padding](/PartDesign_Pad "PartDesign Pad") |

| 16 | Pattern along a curve | * [Draft PathArray](/Draft_PathArray "Draft PathArray") tool |
| 17 | Cut scope - cut tools affecting only selected part of the model | * Different order of operations and use [boolean cut](/Part_Cut "Part Cut") on [padded](/PartDesign_Pad "PartDesign Pad") bodies |
| 18 | Merging adjacent faces | * For faces of a [PartDesign Body](/PartDesign_Body "PartDesign Body"): change the Refine property of the last Feature to `true`, may not remove all the redundant faces * For co-planar faces: use [Draft Upgrade](/Draft_Upgrade "Draft Upgrade") twice to get a [Draft Wire](/Draft_Wire "Draft Wire"), [Draft Downgrade](/Draft_Downgrade "Draft Downgrade") the wire to get a face |

| 8 | [Box selection](/Std_BoxSelection "Std BoxSelection") of TechDraw objects | * Select objects manually, one by one (while holding Ctrl) |
| 9 | Modify regular and section views using sketching tools | * Manually create and modify the views:   1.

Use the [Draft Shape2DView](/Draft_Shape2DView "Draft Shape2DView") tool to create a 2D line representation of the view or section view   3. Use the [Drafting](/Draft_Workbench#Drafting "Draft Workbench") tools with proper [snaps](/Draft_Workbench#Draft_Snap_toolbar "Draft Workbench") to modify the view   4. Use the [Draft Draft2Sketch](/Draft_Draft2Sketch "Draft Draft2Sketch") tool to create a sketch out of the Draft objects   5.
