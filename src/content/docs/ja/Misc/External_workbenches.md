## Introduction

[External workbenches](/External_workbenches "External workbenches") are those created by power users which haven't been integrated into the main FreeCAD source code.

These workbenches aren't supported by the core FreeCAD development team, so they aren't tested to work with every version of FreeCAD. Questions, bug reports, and improvement requests should be made directly to the authors of the workbench.

Workbenches marked with ![](/images/AddonManager.svg) can be installed from the [Addon Manager](/Std_AddonMgr "Std AddonMgr"). For manual installation see [Installing more workbenches](/Installing_more_workbenches "Installing more workbenches"). If there are specific instructions or prerequisites for using an external workbench, then these should be noted on the workbench's home page.

Workbenches marked with ![](/images/Edit_Cancel.svg) are not recommended for recent versions of FreeCAD. They are obsolete, unmaintained, superseded by a newer workbench, or maybe they don't work with Python 3 or with Qt5. In most cases they should be avoided.

## Assembly workbenches

FreeCAD has a built-in [Assembly Workbench](/Assembly_Workbench "Assembly Workbench") ([introduced in 1.0](/Release_notes_1.0 "Release notes 1.0")). There are also several external assembly workbenches. These workbenches are incompatible with each other. If you create an assembly with one of them, you should stick to the original workbench, and not use another assembly workbench in the same document.

There are also 'pseudo assembly' workbenches which actually don't use constraints to keep relationships between parts, but simply re-position them in space.

Currently, the macro has a bit more functionality than the workbench, but eventually the workbench will integrate all existing tools of the macro. They also differ in the graphical user interface; the macro creates a panel next to the tree view and the task panel, while the workbench provides its tools in toolbars, just like other workbenches. | Rentlau | <https://github.com/Rentlau/WorkFeature-WB> |  |  |
