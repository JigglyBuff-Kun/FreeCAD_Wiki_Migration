## Introduction

The ![](/images/Workbench_Ship.svg) [Ship Workbench](/Ship_Workbench "Ship Workbench") is used to create structures that are common to ships.

## The Tools

### Ship Design

- ![](/images/Ship_CreateShip.svg) [Create a new ship](/Ship_CreateShip "Ship CreateShip")
- ![](/images/Ship_AreasCurve.svg) [Areas curve](/Ship_AreasCurve "Ship AreasCurve")
- ![](/images/Ship_Hydrostatics.svg) [Hydrostatics](/Ship_Hydrostatics "Ship Hydrostatics")

### Weights

## History

The Ship Workbench was unmaintained since v0.17 but has been resurrected in v0.19. As of v0.19 it is also designated an [external workbench](/External_workbenches "External workbenches"), so it is no longer included in the base system. Instead it's available via the [Addon Manager](/Std_AddonMgr "Std AddonMgr").
