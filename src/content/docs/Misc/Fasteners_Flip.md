## Description

The ![](/images/Fasteners_Flip.svg) **Fasteners Flip** command inverts the orientation of [attached fasteners](/Fasteners_Workbench#Usage "Fasteners Workbench") by changing their Data**Invert** property.

## Usage

1. Select one or more attached fasteners. The selection may include unattached fasteners, but these will not be flipped. See [Notes](#Notes).
2. There are several ways to invoke the command:
   - Press the ![](/images/Fasteners_Flip.svg) [Invert fastener](/Fasteners_Flip "Fasteners Flip") button.
   - Select the **Fasteners → ![](/images/Fasteners_Flip.svg) Invert fastener** option from the menu.
3. The orientation of the selected attached fasteners is inverted.

## Notes

- The Data**Invert** property is ignored for unattached fasteners and they cannot be flipped with this command. To flip them their Data**Placement** should be changed, for example with the ![](/images/Std_TransformManip.svg) [Std TransformManip](/Std_TransformManip "Std TransformManip") command.
