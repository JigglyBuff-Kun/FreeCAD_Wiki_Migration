## Description

The ![](/src/assets/images/Fasteners_BOM.svg) **Fasteners BOM** command creates a spreadsheet with a bill of materials (BOM) for the fasteners in the document.

A model with a Fasteners BOM spreadsheet

## Usage

1. There are several ways to invoke the command:
   - Press the ![](/src/assets/images/Fasteners_BOM.svg) [Generate BOM](/Fasteners_BOM "Fasteners BOM") button.
   - Select the **Fasteners → ![](/src/assets/images/Fasteners_BOM.svg) Generate BOM** option from the menu.
2. A Fasteners BOM spreadsheet is created.

## Notes

- A Fasteners BOM spreadsheet does not update if fasteners are changed, or if fasteners are added or removed. In such cases the command has to be used to create a new spreadsheet.
- A Fasteners BOM spreadsheet can be exported with the [Spreadsheet Export](/Spreadsheet_Export "Spreadsheet Export") command.
