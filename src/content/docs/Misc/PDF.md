## Description

[Portable Document Format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF) (PDF) is a file format developed by Adobe in the 1990s to present documents, including text and images.

PDF is based on the PostScript language, which is a vector-based format to describe pages. In this sense it's similar to [SVG](/SVG "SVG"), as it allows scaling a drawing to any size without losing its shape or amount of details.

Nevertheless, a PDF can contain many things, including text, fonts, vector graphics, and [bitmap](/Bitmap "Bitmap") images. PDF was standardized as an open format in 2008, as ISO 32000.

PDF is commonly used as a sharing format, that is, to share documents, text, or images, that will display and print exactly as the author intended.

## Usage

As FreeCAD is based on the Qt graphical toolkit, it can export the [3D view](/3D_view "3D view") natively to PDF. This can be useful to export carefully created drawings that other users don't need to modify. For example, pages created with the [TechDraw Workbench](/TechDraw_Workbench "TechDraw Workbench") can be [exported](/Std_Export "Std Export") in this way for sharing or printing. In many cases it is also possible to perform two way conversion between PDF and [SVG](/SVG "SVG").

The option to export to PDF is available in the **File â†’ [Export PDF](/Std_Export "Std Export")** menu.
