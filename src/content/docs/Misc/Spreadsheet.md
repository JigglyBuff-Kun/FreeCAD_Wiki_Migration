## Description

A [spreadsheet](/Spreadsheet "Spreadsheet") is a page that contains rows and columns that allows you to store arbitrary text in cells. More importantly, it allows you to use the cells with [expressions](/Expressions "Expressions") to calculate values that depend on previously entered values; these can be lengths, angles, areas, volumes, and other types.

## Usage

2. Press ![](/src/assets/images/Spreadsheet_CreateSheet.svg) [Spreadsheet CreateSheet](/Spreadsheet_CreateSheet "Spreadsheet CreateSheet") to create a new sheet.
3. Edit the contents of the cells.
4. Close the spreadsheet tab when you are finished, the values are saved automatically as you type them.
