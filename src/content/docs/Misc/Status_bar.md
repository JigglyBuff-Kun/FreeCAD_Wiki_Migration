## Introduction

The [status bar](/Status_bar "Status bar") is a simple ribbon that appears at the bottom of the FreeCAD [interface](/Interface "Interface").

When the mouse pointer is over a button or menu, the usage information of that command is displayed both in a textual popup and in the status bar.

The status bar shows the [mouse navigation](/Mouse_navigation "Mouse navigation") mode and the zoom level on the right. The zoom level gives the size of the current [3D view](/3D_view "3D view") in appropriate units for the current scale, for example, millimeters (mm) or meters (m).

The status bar also shows the last pre-selected object (any object under the pointer is pre-selected) or element of an object (vertex, edge, face), and the coordinates of the mouse pointer when the last pre-selection occurred; this is useful to know immediately the coordinate of specific vertices in your shapes. The 3D coordinates update automatically as long as the mouse pointer floats over a geometrical element; the update stops when the mouse pointer rests over an empty space in the [3D view](/3D_view "3D view").

## Quick measure

[introduced in 1.0](/Release_notes_1.0 "Release notes 1.0")

The Quick measure feature uses the right side of the Status bar to show measurements based on the selection in 3D view:

- Edge length
- Face area
- Distance between points, edges or faces
- Angle between edges
- Radius of circular edges or cylindrical faces
