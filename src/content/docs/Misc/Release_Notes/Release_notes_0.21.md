|     | The [Navigation Cube](/Navigation_Cube "Navigation Cube") has been updated. The cube is no longer shown in perspective if the [3D view](/3D_view "3D view") is in orthographic view mode. Corner faces have been made hexagonal and larger so that they are easier to click. Borders have been added around the buttons. Default font selection and sizing has been improved. The Mini-cube menu now includes a checkbox to toggle the movability of the cube. Several new parameters have been added, see the [Navigation Cube](/Navigation_Cube "Navigation Cube") page for more information.

| Persistent section cut of intersecting objects. Click on the image to see the animation. | The [Section Cut](/Part_SectionCut "Part SectionCut") tool now allows to cut intersecting objects. This is useful for assemblies where intersections of touching objects can sometimes not be avoided due to numerical issues. [Pull request #8252](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/8252). |

|     |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

- Value changes with the mouse wheel in 'input fields' (a widget type used to enter values in task panels, for example by [Draft Line](/Draft_Line "Draft Line")) are disabled if the widget doesn't have the focus and the [ComboBoxWheelEventFilter](/Fine-tuning#Mouse_related "Fine-tuning") parameter is enabled. This prevents unwanted value changes while scrolling, as was already the case for spin and combo boxes. [Pull request #7561](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/7561)
- It is now possible to set a default transparency for new [Part](/Part_Workbench "Part Workbench") or [PartDesign](/PartDesign_Workbench "PartDesign Workbench") objects in the [Preferences](/PartDesign_Preferences "PartDesign Preferences"). [Pull request #7103](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/7103)
- There is the new orbit style **Free Turntable**. It can either be enabled in the [Preferences](/Preferences_Editor#Navigation "Preferences Editor") or by pressing the ![](/images/NavigationCAD_dark.svg) button in the [Status bar](/Status_bar "Status bar") and then using the menu **Settings â†’ Orbit**). [Pull Request #8048](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/8048)
- The [Std SetAppearance](/Std_SetAppearance "Std SetAppearance") task panel now also has a button to set the Point Color property. [Pull request #7708](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/7708)
- A button has been added to switch the colors of the [3D view](/3D_view "3D view") background gradient in the [Preferences](/Preferences_Editor#Colors "Preferences Editor"). [Pull request #7155](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/7155)
- All transparency settings use now the uniform spin button step of 5%: One click on the button in a dialog or the [property editor](/Property_editor "Property editor") changes the transparency by 5%. Keep the button pressed to change several 5% steps at once. [Pull request #7723](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/7723)
- The Output window has been renamed to Report view for uniformity with the UI. [Pull Request #7739](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/7739)
- The Image Workbench has been removed. To insert an Image Plane the [Std Import](/Std_Import "Std Import") command can now be used. Double-click an Image Plane to change its orientation and scale. The new [Std ViewLoadImage](/Std_ViewLoadImage "Std ViewLoadImage") command replaces the Image Open command. [Pull Request #8955](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/8955)
- The deprecated Raytracing Workbench has been removed. The external [Render Workbench](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD-render) should be used instead. [Pull Request #9420](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/9420)

## Addon Manager

- Added basic Python package management for updating and removing automatically-installed dependencies.
- Added a "developer mode" to aid in the creation of the metadata file required in each Addon.

## Arch Workbench

- Several [Arch Profile](/Arch_Profile "Arch Profile") categories have been added: IS RHS, IS SHS, IS Angle and IS Tee. [Pull request #7181](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/7181) and [Pull request #7217](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/7217)
- [Arch Profile](/Arch_Profile "Arch Profile") objects now support modification of the profile type after creation. [Pull request #7217](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/7217)
- Several edit mode issues have been fixed and the [Tree view](/Tree_view "Tree view") context menus for Arch objects have been improved. Objects that can be edited now have an **Edit** option in that menu. The **Set colors** option was removed for objects without a face or that can only have a single face. [Pull request #8122](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/8122)
- [Arch SectionPlane](/Arch_SectionPlane "Arch SectionPlane") objects now handle non-solid objects the same as solid objects. [Pull request #8688](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/8688)

### Further Arch improvements

- The **Invert hinge position** tool has been improved. For all rectangular wires the opposite edge is now correctly detected. [Pull request #8199](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/8199)
- The Terrain of an [Arch Site](/Arch_Site "Arch Site") can now also be a solid. [Pull request #8409](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/8409)
- An [Arch Site](/Arch_Site "Arch Site") no longer shows a phantom representation of the objects in its Group. [Pull request #8409](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/8409)

## Draft Workbench

- The inaccuracy of [Draft Snap Near](/Draft_Snap_Near "Draft Snap Near") when snapping to curves was fixed. In addition, [Draft Snap Perpendicular](/Draft_Snap_Perpendicular "Draft Snap Perpendicular") can now also snap to faces and find multiple points. To snap to a vertex (e.g. a [Draft Point](/Draft_Point "Draft Point")) [Draft Snap Endpoint](/Draft_Snap_Endpoint "Draft Snap Endpoint") must now be used instead of [Draft Snap Near](/Draft_Snap_Near "Draft Snap Near"). [Pull request #7132](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/7132)
- To make working with [layers](/Draft_Layer "Draft Layer") easier their drag and drop behavior was modified. If you drop an object from a [Std Group](/Std_Group "Std Group"), or a group-like object such as an [Arch BuildingPart](/Arch_BuildingPart "Arch BuildingPart"), on a layer, it is no longer removed from the group, and vice versa. This works without holding down the Ctrl key. [Pull request #7462](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/7462)
- The [Draft PointArray](/Draft_PointArray "Draft PointArray") command now supports more point object types. Any object with a shape and vertices, as well as a [mesh](/Mesh_Workbench "Mesh Workbench") and a [point cloud](/Points_Workbench "Points Workbench") can be used. [Pull request #7597](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/7597)
- The [Tree view](/Tree_view "Tree view") context menus for Draft objects have been improved. Objects that can be edited with the [Draft Edit](/Draft_Edit "Draft Edit") command, or that have a dedicated edit solution, now have an **Edit** option in that menu. The **Set colors** option was removed for objects without a face or that can only have a single face. [Pull request #7970](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/7970)
- The properties of Draft annotation objects have been unified. [Draft Text](/Draft_Text "Draft Text"), [Draft Dimension](/Draft_Dimension "Draft Dimension") and [Draft Label](/Draft_Label "Draft Label") objects now all have a Font Name, a Font Size and a Text Color property. The Display Mode options have been made consistent as well and are now: Screen and World. [Issue #7861](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/issues/7861) and [Pull request #8081](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/8081)
- In the task panel of the [Draft SetStyle](/Draft_SetStyle "Draft SetStyle") command the **Texts/dims** button has been replaced by the **Annotations** button. Pressing this button will process all annotations, including [Draft Labels](/Draft_Label "Draft Label"). **Dim overshoot**, **Ext lines** and **Ext overshoot** parameters have been added. Several minor additional issues were also fixed. [Pull request #8190](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/8190), [Pull request #8195](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/8195), [Pull request #8196](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/8196) and [Pull request #9514](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/9514).
- Undo/Redo did not work properly for the Draft modification commands on Windows. [Pull request #8267](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/8267)
- The [LayerManager command](/Draft_LayerManager "Draft LayerManager") has been migrated from the BIM Workbench to the Draft Workbench. [Pull request #8795](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/8795)

### Further Draft improvements

- When aligning the working plane with a face it was only rotated to match the global axes if the face was a quad. [Pull request #7249](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/7249)
- Several [Draft PathArray](/Draft_PathArray "Draft PathArray") related issues have been fixed. [Pull request #7506](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/7506) and [Pull request #7662](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/7662)
- The [Draft Edit](/Draft_Edit "Draft Edit") command has received several improvements. For [wires](/Draft_Wire "Draft Wire"), [B-splines](/Draft_BSpline "Draft BSpline") and [BÃ©zier curves](/Draft_BezCurve "Draft BezCurve") a Close/Open option has been added to the edge context menu. For B-splines and BÃ©zier curves a Reverse option has been added to the same menu as well. The task panels have been cleaned up. [Pull request #7527](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/7527) and [Pull request #7541](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/7541)
- Using Esc to exit a command no longer switches off continue mode. [Pull request #7611](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/7611)
- The [Draft Snap](/Draft_Snap "Draft Snap") toolbar was changed to a standard toolbar. Keyboard shortcuts can now be assigned to snaps. But using them during a command only works if none of the input boxes in the task panel has the focus as they 'catch' the so-called in-command shortcuts. [Pull request #7656](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/7656)
- Several [Draft AnnotationStyleEditor](/Draft_AnnotationStyleEditor "Draft AnnotationStyleEditor") bugs have been fixed. The **Text color** and **Text spacing** parameters have been added. [Pull request #8207](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/8207) and [Pull request #9702](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/9702)
- Start and End Offset properties have been added to [Draft PathArray](/Draft_PathArray "Draft PathArray") objects. [Pull request #8295](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/8295)
- A Count property has been added to the arrays that lacked this property: the non-Link versions of [Draft OrthoArray](/Draft_OrthoArray "Draft OrthoArray"), [Draft PolarArray](/Draft_PolarArray "Draft PolarArray") and [Draft CircularArray](/Draft_CircularArray "Draft CircularArray"). [Pull request #8433](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/8433)
- The on/off behavior of the [grid](/Draft_Snap_Grid "Draft Snap Grid") has been fixed. [Pull request #8818](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/8818)

### Further FEM improvements

- When performing analyses using the ![](/images/FEM_SolverCalculixCxxtools.svg) [CalculiX solver](/FEM_SolverCalculixCxxtools "FEM SolverCalculixCxxtools"), there is now also a [results pipeline](/FEM_PostPipelineFromResult "FEM PostPipelineFromResult") created to visualize the results. [Pull request #8525](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/8525) and [Pull request #8903](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/8903)
- It is now possible to perform [transient analyses](</FEM_SolverElmer_SolverSettings#Timestepping_(transient_analyses)> "FEM SolverElmer SolverSettings") when using the ![](/images/FEM_SolverElmer.svg) [Elmer solver](/FEM_SolverElmer "FEM SolverElmer"). [Pull request #9056](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/9056)
- The ![](/images/FEM_ConstraintInitialPressure.svg) [initial pressure constraint](/FEM_ConstraintInitialPressure "FEM ConstraintInitialPressure") was added to set the initial internal pressure of fluids. [Pull request #7364](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/7364)
- The ![](/images/FEM_ConstraintCurrentDensity.svg) [current density constraint](/FEM_ConstraintCurrentDensity "FEM ConstraintCurrentDensity") was added to set current densities for bodies and faces. [Pull request #8348](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/8348)
- The ![](/images/FEM_ConstraintMagnetization.svg) [magnetization constraint](/FEM_ConstraintMagnetization "FEM ConstraintMagnetization") was added to set magnetizations for bodies and faces. [Pull request #8393](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/8393)
- The ![](/images/FEM_ConstraintFlowVelocity.svg) [flow velocity constraint](/FEM_ConstraintFlowVelocity "FEM ConstraintFlowVelocity") and ![](/images/FEM_ConstraintInitialFlowVelocity.svg) [initial flow velocity constraint](/FEM_ConstraintInitialFlowVelocity "FEM ConstraintInitialFlowVelocity") were completely rewritten. It is now also possible to specify a velocity via a math formula (to define a velocity profile). [Pull request #8963](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/8963) and [Pull request #8964](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/8964)  
  **Note:** This is a breaking change. Analyses with existing flow velocity and initial flow velocity constraints will not work anymore. You have to create new flow velocity constraints in the analysis to make existing analyses work.  
  **Also note:** until FreeCAD 0.21 the results of the flow solver were wrong (fluid density and viscosity were a factor 1000 too high). Therefore the necessary recreation of the velocity constraint also assures the results will be correct.
- It is now possible to define in the ![](/images/FEM_ConstraintDisplacement.svg) [displacement constraint](/FEM_ConstraintDisplacement "FEM ConstraintDisplacement") displacements as equations (displacement according to the current solver time).
- The ![](/images/FEM_ConstraintBodyHeatSource.svg) [body heat source constraint](/FEM_ConstraintBodyHeatSource "FEM ConstraintBodyHeatSource") has now a task panel and it is possible to set the heat for several bodies or to use several constraints for different bodies in one analysis. [Pull request #7367](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/7367)
- The ![](/images/FEM_ConstraintSpring.svg) [spring constraint](/FEM_ConstraintSpring "FEM ConstraintSpring") was not used by any solver. Now it can be used by the [Elmer](/FEM_SolverElmer "FEM SolverElmer") solver via the equations [Deformation](/FEM_EquationDeformation "FEM EquationDeformation") and [Elasticity](/FEM_EquationElasticity "FEM EquationElasticity"). [Pull request #9005](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/9005)
- The result mesh cut function ![](/images/FEM_PostCreateFunctionCylinder.svg) [Filter function cylinder](/FEM_PostCreateFunctionCylinder "FEM PostCreateFunctionCylinder") was added. [Pull request #8735](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/8735)
- The result mesh cut function ![](/images/FEM_PostCreateFunctionBox.svg) [Filter function box](/FEM_PostCreateFunctionBox "FEM PostCreateFunctionBox") was added. [Pull request #8825](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/8825)
- It is now possible to open (and this way visualize) \*.pvtu files (partitioned VTK unstructured grid data). A \*.pvtu file is also the result of an [Elmer](/FEM_SolverElmer "FEM SolverElmer") simulation, when more than one CPU core is used for calculations. [Pull request #7159](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/7159)
- Critical Strain Ratio has been added to the VTK result pipeline. It gives an indication of ductile rupture for materials with a "MaterialMechanicalNonlinear" object. [Pull request #7467](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/7467)

* ![](/images/FEM_FemMesh2Mesh.svg) [FEM mesh to mesh](/FEM_FemMesh2Mesh "FEM FemMesh2Mesh") has the new parameter _scale_ to define the scale of deformed mesh using Python. [Forum thread](https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=71936) and [Pull request #7715](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/7715)

- The [preferences](/FEM_Preferences "FEM Preferences") have a new option to define which solver should automatically be added when creating a new analysis.
- Usability improvements:
  - If you are in the FEM workbench when loading a FreeCAD file containing an analysis, the analysis gets activated automatically (you have immediate access to all FEM toolbar buttons).
  - The toolbar only has buttons for solvers installed on your system. Unavailable solvers are no longer displayed.
- New example files for the following equations are available via the [FEM Examples](/FEM_Examples "FEM Examples"): [Deformation](/FEM_EquationDeformation "FEM EquationDeformation"), [Flow](/FEM_EquationFlow "FEM EquationFlow"), [Flux](/FEM_EquationFlux "FEM EquationFlux"), [Heat](/FEM_EquationHeat "FEM EquationHeat"), [Magnetodynamic](/FEM_EquationMagnetodynamic "FEM EquationMagnetodynamic") and [Magnetodynamic 2D](/FEM_EquationMagnetodynamic2D "FEM EquationMagnetodynamic2D").

| --- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|     | The UX on multiple PartDesign task dialogs for selecting geometries has been improved, now no longer requiring the use of separate buttons for adding or removing geometries to the selection. [Pull request #8990](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/8990) |

### Further PartDesign improvements

- In the [Hole](/PartDesign_Hole "PartDesign Hole") dialog, the deprecated screw head types (cheese head, cap screw etc.) have been removed. They were deprecated since FreeCAD 0.19. Holes using these types are transformed to custom countersinks/counterbore holes with the diameter and depth used by the types. [Pull request #7654](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/7654)
- In the [Additive Loft](/PartDesign_AdditiveLoft "PartDesign AdditiveLoft") and [Subtractive Loft](/PartDesign_SubtractiveLoft "PartDesign SubtractiveLoft") dialogs, the previously non-functional option **Closed** does now create a closed loft (like a ring). [Pull request #8748](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/8748)
- The [Validate sketch](/Sketcher_ValidateSketch "Sketcher ValidateSketch") command was added to Helper toolbar. [Pull request #7700](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/7700)
- The unusable [Leave sketch](/Sketcher_LeaveSketch "Sketcher LeaveSketch") and [View sketch](/Sketcher_ViewSketch "Sketcher ViewSketch") commands were removed from the menu. The [Edit sketch](/Sketcher_EditSketch "Sketcher EditSketch"), [Merge sketches](/Sketcher_MergeSketches "Sketcher MergeSketches") and [Mirror sketch](/Sketcher_MirrorSketch "Sketcher MirrorSketch") commands were added to the menu. [Pull request #7700](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/7700)
- The [involute gear profile](/PartDesign_InvoluteGear "PartDesign InvoluteGear") has new properties to change the tooth length. This now allows adjustments for certain types of interferences and to use the profile to create [involute splines](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spline_(mechanical)>) too. [Pull request #8184](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/8184)
- The [involute gear profile](/PartDesign_InvoluteGear "PartDesign InvoluteGear") now offers profile shifting. [Issue #5618](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/issues/5618) and [Pull request #8934](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/8934)
- When creating a [Clone](/PartDesign_Clone "PartDesign Clone") it will now inherit the colors of the cloned object. [Pull request #9547](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/9547)

## Path Workbench

- Camotics integration. If camotics (version 1.2.2 or later) is installed, a new icon will be added to the Path toolbar. Select a Path Job and press the button to open the Camotics dialog. Then drag the slider to generate a simulated solid at any point in the job. You can also launch the full camotics application to run the animated simulaton. This results in a silent post-processing of the job and creation of a camotics project file. [Pull request #6637](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/6637)

- Additional substitution strings for automatic output naming. If output is being split into multiple files, the filenames can automatically substitute the toolcontroller label, Work Coordinate Systems (WCS), or operation label. This is in addition to the other existing substitution strings like date, job name, etc.

- Implemented Chipbreaking option for peck style drill cycles. Chipbreaking emits a G73 cycle which causes the control to make a very small retraction move to break the chip without fully retracting the bit from the hole. G73 is supported natively by LinuxCNC. Some other postprocessors will have to interpret the G73 and emit control appropriate codes or decompose the retraction into G1/G0 moves. Postprocessor support for G73 decomposition has been added to the "refactored" postprocessors.[Pull request #7469](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/7469)

- A function to remove overlapping edges returned by the hidden line removal algorithm was added, including a new setting (in advanced preferences) for the number of passes of this function. [Pull request #9280](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/pull/9280)

## Known Limitations

### 32bit Windows

Since FreeCAD 0.19 we no longer officially support 32bit Windows. FreeCAD might work on these systems, but no support is given.

### Remote Desktop under Windows

Depending on the OpenGL graphics capabilities of a computer, it might be that one encounters a crash when running FreeCAD via remote desktop. To fix this upgrade your OpenGL driver.
Only if this doesn't help:

- Download [this](https://downloads.fdossena.com/geth.php?r=mesa64-latest) OpenGL library for 64bit Windows and extract it.
- Rename the DLL file to _opengl32sw.dll_ and copy it to the _bin_ subfolder of FreeCAD's installation folder (overwrite the existing DLL there).

### macOS: Start Workbench shows blank page

If the [Start Workbench](/Start_Workbench "Start Workbench") shows only a blank page, you must enable the option **Use software OpenGL** in the menu **FreeCAD-0.21 â†’ Preferences â†’ Display**.
