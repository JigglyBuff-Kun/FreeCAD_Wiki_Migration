## Description

The ![](/images/Fasteners_Simplify.svg) **Fasteners Simplify** command creates non-parametric copies of fasteners. This can be useful if you want to share a document containing fasteners with users who do not have the [Fasteners Workbench](/Fasteners_Workbench "Fasteners Workbench") installed.

## Usage

1. Select one or more fasteners.
2. There are several ways to invoke the command:
   - Press the ![](/images/Fasteners_Simplify.svg) [Simplify shape](/Fasteners_Simplify "Fasteners Simplify") button.
   - Select the **Fasteners → ![](/images/Fasteners_Simplify.svg) Simplify shape** option from the menu.
3. For each fastener a simplified copy is created.
4. The View**Visibility** property of the original fasteners is set to `false`.
5. Optionally delete the original fasteners.
