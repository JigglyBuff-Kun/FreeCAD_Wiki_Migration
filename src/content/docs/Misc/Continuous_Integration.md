## Continuous Integration

Currently the FreeCAD repository on GitHub will trigger a build on several CI systems. Between these systems pretty much all the main OSs are coveredː Linux, macOS, and Windows. CIs can also be used to run [unit tests](/Testing "Testing").

## Tips

* If you add `[skip ci]` or `[ci skip]` to a git commit it will cancel a CI build.

## Relevant links
