## Description

The ![](/images/Draft_Heal.svg) **Draft Heal** command heals problematic [Draft](/Draft_Workbench "Draft Workbench") objects found in very old files. It tries to recreate the old objects from scratch and transfer their properties to the new objects.

## Usage

1. Optionally select one or more problematic objects. If no objects are selected the entire document will be processed.
2. Select the **Utilities → ![](/images/Draft_Heal.svg) Heal** option from the menu.
3. If no errors are found the command will do nothing.
