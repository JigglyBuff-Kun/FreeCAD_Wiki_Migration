## Beskrivning

This command allows you to place a clipping rectangle on a [Drawing page](/Drawing_Landscape_A3 "Drawing Landscape A3"). [Drawing View](/Drawing_View "Drawing View") objects can then be added to that clipping rectangle, and their display will be truncated by the borders of the rectangle.

## Bruk

1. Create a [Drawing page](/Drawing_Landscape_A3 "Drawing Landscape A3")
2. [Refresh](/Std_Refresh "Std Refresh") the view if a Drawing view wasn't opened
3. Press the ![](/images/Drawing_Clip.png) [Drawing Clip](/Drawing_Clip "Drawing Clip") button
4. Adjust the desired properties, such as size and position.
5. Drag and Drop [Drawing View](/Drawing_View "Drawing View") objects on the Clip object in the Tree View

## Options

* A property allows you to show or hide the clipping rectangle itself.

## Limitations

* Clipping objects are not displayed properly by the internal Qt-based Svg viewer, but the [Open Browser](/Drawing_Openbrowser "Drawing Openbrowser") command shows them correctly.
