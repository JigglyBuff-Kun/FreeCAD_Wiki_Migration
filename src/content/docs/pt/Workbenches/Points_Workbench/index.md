## Introduction

The ![](/images/Workbench_Points.svg) [Points Workbench](/Points_Workbench "Points Workbench") offers specific tools for working with [point clouds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_cloud). The workbench is still in development.

A point cloud is a collection of points in 3D space. A point cloud is generally produced by scanning the surface of a solid object. The cloud of points can then be used for many purposes including building a mesh for the object, reconstructing the surfaces and solid volumes, reverse engineering, as well as for visualization and quality inspection.

## Tools

All Points Workbench tools can be accessed from the **Points** menu and the **Points tools** toolbar.

- ![](/images/Points_Import.svg) [Import points...](/Points_Import "Points Import"): Imports a point cloud from a file.

- ![](/images/Points_Export.svg) [Export points...](/Points_Export "Points Export"): Exports a point cloud to a file.

- ![](/images/Points_Convert.svg) [Convert to points...](/Points_Convert "Points Convert"): Creates point clouds from shape objects.

- ![](/images/Points_Structure.svg) [Structured point cloud](/Points_Structure "Points Structure"): Creates a structured point cloud from the points of an existing point cloud.

- ![](/images/Points_Merge.svg) [Merge point clouds](/Points_Merge "Points Merge"): Creates a point cloud by combining the points of two or more point clouds.

- ![](/images/Points_PolyCut.svg) [Cut point cloud](/Points_PolyCut "Points PolyCut"): Cuts points from point clouds.

## Notes

- [Draft](/Draft_Workbench "Draft Workbench") commands such as ![](/images/Draft_Line.svg) [Draft Line](/Draft_Line "Draft Line") and ![](/images/Draft_BSpline.svg) [Draft B-spline](/Draft_BSpline "Draft BSpline") can be used to connect the points in a point cloud. Use ![](/images/Draft_Snap_Endpoint.svg) [Draft Snap Endpoint](/Draft_Snap_Endpoint "Draft Snap Endpoint") to snap to the points.
- [Python](/Python "Python") can be used to analyze and process point clouds. See the following forum discussions:
