## Description

A ![](/images/Part_Spiral.svg) **Part Spiral** is a parametric shape that can be created with the ![](/images/Part_Primitives.svg) [Part Primitives](/Part_Primitives "Part Primitives") command. In the coordinate system defined by its Údaje**Placement** property, the spiral lies on the XY plane with its center at the origin and its start point on the X axis. It widens as it turns counterclockwise.

## Usage

See [Part Primitives](/Part_Primitives#Usage "Part Primitives").

Part Spiral from the scripting example

A Part Spiral object created with the [scripting example](#Scripting) below is shown here.

## Properties

See also: [Property editor](/Property_editor "Property editor").

A Part Spiral object is derived from a [Part Feature](/Part_Feature "Part Feature") object and inherits all its properties. It also has the following additional properties:

### Data

Attachment

The object has the same attachment properties as a [Part Part2DObject](/Part_Part2DObject#Data "Part Part2DObject").

Spiral

* Údaje**Growth** (`Length`): The distance between two consecutive turns of the spiral. The default is `1mm`.
* Údaje**Radius** (`Length`): The start radius of the spiral, the distance between its center and its start point. Can be `0mm`. The default is `1mm`.
* Údaje**Rotations** (`QuantityConstraint`): The number of rotations, or turns, of the spiral. The default is `2`.
* Údaje**Segment Length** (`QuantityConstraint`): The number of turns per spiral subdivision. The default is `1`, meaning each full turn of the spiral is a separate segment. Use `0` to suppress subdivision.

## Scripting

See also: [Autogenerated API documentation](https://freecad.github.io/SourceDoc/), [Part scripting](/Part_scripting "Part scripting") and [FreeCAD Scripting Basics](/FreeCAD_Scripting_Basics "FreeCAD Scripting Basics").

A Part Spiral can be created with the `addObject()` method of the document:

```
spiral = FreeCAD.ActiveDocument.addObject("Part::Spiral", "mySpiral")

```

* Where `"mySpiral"` is the name for the object.
* The function returns the newly created object.

Example:

```
import FreeCAD as App

doc = App.activeDocument()

spiral = doc.addObject("Part::Spiral", "mySpiral")
spiral.Growth = 2
spiral.Radius = 3
spiral.Rotations = 4
spiral.Placement = App.Placement(App.Vector(1, 2, 3), App.Rotation(75, 60, 30))

doc.recompute()

```
