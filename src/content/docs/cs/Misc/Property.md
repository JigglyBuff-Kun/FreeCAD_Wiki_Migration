## Introduction

A **property** is a piece of information like a number or a text string that is attached to a FreeCAD document or an object in a document. Properties can be viewed and - if allowed - modified with the [Property editor](/Property_editor "Property editor").

Properties play a very important part in FreeCAD, since it is from the beginning made to work with parametric objects, which are objects defined only by their properties.

Custom [scripted objects](/Scripted_objects "Scripted objects") in FreeCAD can have properties of the following types:

```
Boolean
Float
FloatList
FloatConstraint
Angle
Distance
Integer
IntegerConstraint
Percent
Enumeration
IntegerList
String
StringList
Link
LinkList
Matrix
Vector
VectorList
Placement
PlacementLink
Color
ColorList
Material
Path
File
FileIncluded
PartShape
FilletContour
Circle

```

Properties play a very important role in FreeCAD. As objects in FreeCAD are "parametric", this means that their behavior is defined by their properties, and how these properties are used as input for their class methods.

Internally, the property name is prefixed with `App::Property`:

```
App::PropertyBool
App::PropertyFloat
App::PropertyFloatList
...

```

Remember that these are property *types*. A single object may have many properties of the same type, but with different names.

For example:

```
obj.addProperty("App::PropertyFloat", "Length")
obj.addProperty("App::PropertyFloat", "Width")
obj.addProperty("App::PropertyFloat", "Height")

```

This indicates an object with three properties of type "Float", named "Length", "Width", and "Height", respectively.

## Scripting

*See also:* [FreeCAD scripting basics](/FreeCAD_Scripting_Basics "FreeCAD Scripting Basics")

A [scripted object](/Scripted_objects "Scripted objects") is created first, and then properties are assigned.

```
obj = App.ActiveDocument.addObject("Part::Feature", "CustomObject")

obj.addProperty("App::PropertyFloat", "Velocity", "Parameter", "Body speed")
obj.addProperty("App::PropertyBool", "VelocityEnabled", "Parameter", "Enable body speed")

```

In general, *Data* properties are assigned by using the object's `addProperty()` method. On the other hand, *View* properties are normally provided automatically by the parent object from which the scripted object is derived.

For example:

* Deriving from `App::FeaturePython` provides only 4 *View* properties: "Display Mode", "On Top When Selected", "Show In Tree", and "Visibility".
* Deriving from `Part::Feature` provides 17 *View* properties: the previous four, plus "Angular Deflection", "Bounding Box", "Deviation", "Draw Style", "Lighting", "Line Color", "Line Width", "Point Color", "Point Size", "Selectable", "Selection Style", "Shape Color", and "Transparency".

Nevertheless, *View* properties can also be assigned using the view provider object's `addProperty()` method.

```
obj.ViewObject.addProperty("App::PropertyBool", "SuperVisibility", "Base", "Make the object glow")

```

## Source code

In the source code, properties are located in various src/App/Property\* files.

They are imported and initialized in `src/App/Application.cpp`.

```
#include "Property.h"
#include "PropertyContainer.h"
#include "PropertyUnits.h"
#include "PropertyFile.h"
#include "PropertyLinks.h"
#include "PropertyPythonObject.h"
#include "PropertyExpressionEngine.h"

```
