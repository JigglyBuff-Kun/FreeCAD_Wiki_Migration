## Beschreibung

The tool ![](/images/CAM_DressupPathBoundary.svg) [DressupPathBoundary](/CAM_DressupPathBoundary "CAM DressupPathBoundary") allows restricting the extent of a path to a smaller part of the object. For example, restricting a profile path to just one face or part of the model.

## Anwendung

1. Select a path such as contour, profile or pocket operation.
2. Select the **CAM → Path Dressup → ![](/images/CAM_DressupPathBoundary.svg) Boundary** option from the menu.

## Optionen

* **Create Box**
* **Create Cylinder**
* **Extend Model's Boundary Box**: A very convenient way to limit a path is to select this option and use negative values.
* **Use Existing Solid**

## Einschränkungen

* The *Create Box* option only sets the dimensions of the box, not its origin. To alter its origin it is necessary to adjust its *Placement* in the [tree view](/Tree_view "Tree view").
